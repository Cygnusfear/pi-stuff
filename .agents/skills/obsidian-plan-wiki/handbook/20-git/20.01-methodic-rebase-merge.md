# 20.01 Methodic Rebase-Merge (Investigate)

## Instructions:

ok I need you to pay sharp fucking full attention, no rushing
- **ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT BRANCH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY (CRITICAL)**
- commit everything in worktree
- backup branch from that
- INVESTIGATE what would happen if we rebase on **local main**, and I mean it- need to see the conflicts up front so we're not surprised, we know in advance how to solve it all
	- you make a plan to solve each conflict in advance
	- display that in a way I can read it
then talk to me, NO REBASING, ONLY INVESTIGATE, need to tell me all the plan details to do the rebase
*after any rebase*
- run applicable tests
- verify integrity / loss of important details
- are things wired up? or unwired?
