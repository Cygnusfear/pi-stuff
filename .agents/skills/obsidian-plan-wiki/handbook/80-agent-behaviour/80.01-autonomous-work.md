# 80.01 Autonomous Work

## Autonomous
look-- don't 'fix' it and talk to me like a fucking child who has a list of tasks and going 'dada dada loook I'm done'. It all needs to work, I don't want to fucking handhold you and tell you 'ok buddy, next task'

## Do shit MOFO
you're acting like a little doofus on his first day at the fucking job. Picking his fucking nose, waiting for people to boss him around. I need more from you, you can do better. You're not here to stand around and know better, you need to do shit.
