# Agent Instructions: docs/handbook

Purpose: process, tooling, and repo workflow documentation.

Rules:
- Follow `/AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- Use Johnny Decimal IDs for subfolders and file prefixes (e.g., `10.02-build-pipeline.md`).
- Keep instructions actionable and step-by-step.
- Update related links when moving or renaming handbook docs.
