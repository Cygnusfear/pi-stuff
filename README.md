## Install

```bash
pi install https://github.com/cygnusfear/pi-stuff
```

Updates with `pi update`. Skills live in a separate repo: [agent-skills](https://github.com/cygnusfear/agent-skills).

## Extensions

### Core kit

Workflow relies heavily on the use of [tk](https://github.com/wedow/ticket) as the main driver of inter-agent communication, coordination, task management, and archiving. Oracle & Delphi skills use `teams`, which in turns relies on `tk` for coordination.

| Extension     | What it does                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teams`       | Spawn parallel worker agents with git worktree isolation, using `tk` for coordination |
| `todos-tk.ts` | Ticket management via `tk` — create, list, comment, complete                          |

## Provenance & Credits

Standing on the shoulders of giants — and occasionally raiding their repos.

### Core

| Project | What we owe them |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| [badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) | Pi itself — the coding agent TUI framework everything here extends |
| [wedow/ticket](https://github.com/wedow/ticket) (`tk`) | Ticket system that drives our entire workflow: task management, inter-agent coordination, archiving |

### Hashline editing — [can1357/oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi)

**Can Bölük** invented hashline editing. Every line is tagged with a short content hash (`11:a3|function hello() {`), and edits reference anchors instead of reproducing content. If the file changed since last read, hashes mismatch and the edit is safely rejected.

His [benchmark](https://blog.can.ac/2026/02/12/the-harness-problem/) across 16 models showed hashline matches or beats `str_replace` and `apply_patch` for nearly every model — Grok Code Fast went from 6.7% → 68.3% just by changing the edit format. Our `hashline-tools.ts` is directly from his implementation.

### Teams — [tmustier/pi-agent-teams](https://github.com/tmustier/pi-agent-teams)

**Thomas Mustier** built the first Pi extension bringing Claude Code–style agent teams to Pi — shared task lists, auto-claim, file-based IPC, and worktree isolation. Our `teams/` extension takes the same core idea but pivots all coordination through `tk` tickets instead of file-per-task state.

### Subagents — [can1357/oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) & [nicobailon/pi-subagents](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents)

Can Bölük built [`@oh-my-pi/subagents`](https://npmjs.com/package/@oh-my-pi/subagents) — a task delegation system with specialized agents (task, planner, explore, reviewer, browser) and structured output. **Nico Bailon** built `pi-subagents` — async subagent delegation with chains, parallel execution, and session sharing. Both informed our teams design, which reimplements these concepts around `tk` tickets and git worktree isolation.

### UI & extensions

| Project | What we took |
| ------- | ------------ |
| [anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) | The `apply_patch` diff format (originally from OpenAI Codex), agent markdown patterns, and general TUI coding agent design |
| [charmbracelet/lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) | Theme system and color palette |
| [nicobailon/pi-powerline-footer](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-powerline-footer) | Powerline status bar — vendored and extended |
| [romkatv/powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) | Powerline design language and Nerd Font auto-detection |
| [@aliou/pi-defaults](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aliou/pi-utils-settings) | Settings system, UI utilities, theme selector, project init wizard |
