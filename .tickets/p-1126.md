## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:20:42Z**

Started research: gathering 2025-2026 active cosmology podcasts via Brave, then mapping recent episodes + recurring hot topics.

**2026-02-25T09:21:19Z**

Progress: validated active shows and recency from primary sources (official pages + Apple listings): StarTalk, Supermassive, Ask a Spaceman, Space Nuts, Mindscape, Origins, 365 Days of Astronomy.

Findings (Brave research snapshot, Feb 2026):
1) StarTalk Radio (active) — recent Jan-Feb 2026 episodes include 'Cosmic Queries – The Complex Universe with Sean Carroll' (Jan 13, 2026), 'Your God Is Too Small' (Feb 10, 2026), and updated cosmology/Hubble-tension coverage with Wendy Freedman/Hakeem Oluseyi. Topics: Hubble tension, dark energy evolution, JWST, dark matter, black holes.
2) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS, active) — Apple listing shows 2026 releases including 'Q&A: Meteors, Artemis II, and Space Bathtubs' (Jan 29, 2026) and '2026: The year in space...'. Topics: multiverse questions, cosmology explainers, observation missions shaping cosmology context.
3) Ask a Spaceman! (active) — Paul M. Sutter site and Apple show Jan-Feb 2026 episodes: 'Does Antimatter Fall Up?' (Feb 3, 2026), 'Quantum Eraser' (Jan 20), 'Does the Universe Have Extra Dimensions?' (Dec 16, 2025). Topics: gravity tests, extra dimensions, early-universe/structure questions, black dwarfs.
4) Space Nuts (active, frequent) — Apple + show site indicate ongoing Jan-Feb 2026 episodes and weekly cadence. Recent topics include dark matter, expanding universe, black holes, gravitational-wave/wormhole interpretations, and JWST-linked cosmology discussion.
5) Sean Carroll's Mindscape (active) — 2025-2026 episodes/AMA heavily discuss DESI/DES evidence versus Lambda-CDM: possible time-varying dark energy, distinction from Hubble tension, and implications for future expansion scenarios.
6) The Origins Podcast with Lawrence Krauss (active) — late 2025/early 2026 episodes with Sabine Hossenfelder and others discuss wormhole claims, dark stars, collider constraints, and prebiotic chemistry; recurring cosmology framing around dark matter/dark energy and foundations.
7) 365 Days of Astronomy (active) — Jan-Feb 2026 posts/Apple entries show daily/near-daily astronomy pipeline with cosmology-adjacent discussion (Little Red Dots, oldest supernovae, JWST-era interpretation updates, stellar evolution and survey context).

Cross-podcast hot topics (2025-2026):
- DESI/DES pressure on strict Lambda-CDM and whether dark energy evolves with time.
- Hubble tension (distance ladder vs early-universe inferences) remains unresolved and central.
- JWST cosmology anomalies/updates (Little Red Dots, early massive structures, high-resolution dark-matter mapping from COSMOS-Web).
- Dark matter mapping and weak-lensing results (JWST + broader survey ecosystem).
- Black hole growth in the early universe and links to cosmic structure formation.

Method note: prioritized primary sources first (official show pages, Apple listings, direct episode pages), then used broader coverage to triangulate topic trends.

**2026-02-25T09:21:35Z**

DONE: Researched active cosmology podcasts (2025-2026) with Brave and documented 7 active shows, recent episodes, and converging hot topics. Main trendline: Hubble tension + DESI/DES dark-energy-evolution signals + JWST-driven dark-matter/cosmic-structure updates dominate current discussion across major shows.

**2026-02-25T09:21:50Z**

DONE: Task completed.
