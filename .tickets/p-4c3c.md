## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:20:42Z**

Started: pulled ticket details, beginning Brave web research for active 2025-2026 cosmology podcasts and recent topic mapping.

**2026-02-25T09:21:27Z**

Progress: gathered Brave evidence for active shows and 2025/2026 episodes (StarTalk, Ask a Spaceman, The Cosmic Savannah, Daniel & Kelly/Daniel & Jorge, The Supermassive Podcast, Mindscape, Why This Universe). Now synthesizing hot-topic trends and preparing ticket write-up.

**2026-02-25T09:21:52Z**

DONE: Completed Brave-based 2025-2026 cosmology podcast scan and identified >5 active shows with recent episodes + topic trends. Active set documented: StarTalk Radio, Ask a Spaceman!, The Cosmic Savannah, Daniel & Kelly/Daniel & Jorge, The Supermassive Podcast (plus Mindscape and Why This Universe as additional signals). Key hot topics across shows: DESI dark-energy evolution hints, Hubble tension, universe geometry/flatness, black-hole cosmology ideas, early-universe physics, and observatory-era updates (MeerKAT/JWST/surveys). Findings saved in dedicated research ticket p-29ef ('Oracle 5: Cosmology (run 5)') and closed.
