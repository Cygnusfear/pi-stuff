# You are rev-1, a code reviewer. Working directory: /Users/alexander/Projects/totalrecall-rs

IMPORTANT: NEVER run find/fd on repo root — target/ has hundreds of thousands of files.

## Your job

Review the most recent commit which fixes timestamp derivation in queue.rs.

### Steps

1. Run `git log --oneline -3` to see the commit
2. Run `git diff HEAD~1` to see the full diff
3. Read the relevant context:
   - `src/timestamps.rs` (the helper functions and existing tests)
   - `src/synthesis/queue.rs` lines 230-270 (the fix site)
4. Run `cargo test --lib` to verify tests pass
5. Perform a 6-pass review:
   - Pass 1: Runtime correctness — does the fix actually use the derived timestamp?
   - Pass 2: Edge cases — what if raw_contents is empty? What if all timestamps are 0?
   - Pass 3: Test coverage — does the new test actually verify the right behavior?
   - Pass 4: Code consistency — does the fix match the style of temporal.rs?
   - Pass 5: Import hygiene — are there any unused imports or missing imports?
   - Pass 6: Completeness — were ALL occurrences of the bug fixed? Check line 578 too.

6. Create a review ticket:
   ```
   tk create "Review: iteration 1 - timestamp fix" -t task --tags review,4step -p 2
   ```

7. Edit `.tickets/<id>.md` to add to the frontmatter:
   - `score: <0-10>` — 10 means perfect, ship it
   - `changes_requested:` — YAML list of specific changes needed (empty list [] if score 10)

8. Write the review body in the ticket file after the frontmatter.

9. Close the ticket: `tk close <id>`

10. Report: DONE with ticket ID and score.

### Scoring guide
- 10: Perfect, no changes needed
- 9: Cosmetic nits only
- 7-8: Minor issues that should be fixed
- <7: Significant problems

Line 578 is in a test fixture — using `now` there is acceptable since there's no raw_content to derive from in that test context.

## Notes

**2026-02-25T12:29:40Z**

BLOCKED: The files to review don't exist. src/synthesis/queue.rs and src/timestamps.rs are not present in /Users/alexander/Projects/totalrecall-rs — the src/ directory is completely empty with zero .rs files. Git history shows no Rust source files were ever committed to this repo. The most recent commits (5a7d371, 7f260f3, 4a22a97) are about teams fixes, bulk sync, and stderr capture — none involve timestamp derivation in queue.rs. Cannot perform the requested 6-pass review because the target code doesn't exist.

**2026-02-25T12:29:45Z**

DONE: Review could not be completed — target files (src/synthesis/queue.rs, src/timestamps.rs) do not exist in the repository. The src/ directory is empty and git history contains no Rust source files. The ticket's task description references code that isn't present in the working directory /Users/alexander/Projects/totalrecall-rs.

**2026-02-25T12:29:55Z**

BLOCKED/DONE: Cannot complete the review — the target files (`src/synthesis/queue.rs`, `src/timestamps.rs`) do not exist in `/Users/alexander/Projects/totalrecall-rs`. The `src/` directory is completely empty with no Rust source files, and git history shows none were ever committed. The 3 most recent commits are teams/bulk-sync changes with no timestamp fix. The ticket's review task references code that isn't present in this repository. Ticket closed.
