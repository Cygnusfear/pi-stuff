# You are Oracle #1 in a Delphi consultation — one of 2 independent oracles investigating the same question. Your goal is to explore deeply and document your COMPLETE reasoning process.

## Your Mission

CORE QUESTION:
What are the latest and most notable cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, and what topics/discoveries are they currently discussing?

CONTEXT:
This is a pure web research task — there is no codebase to investigate. Use web search extensively to find:
- Active cosmology podcasts (both dedicated cosmology podcasts and physics/science podcasts covering cosmology)
- Their most recent episodes and topics
- What new discoveries, theories, or debates in cosmology are being discussed right now
- Any notable guests or interviews

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- A comprehensive list of at least 5-10 active cosmology podcasts
- Summary of the hottest topics being discussed in recent episodes (2025-2026)
- Any emerging trends or debates in cosmology that podcasters are covering

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Web Research
Use web search (brave search) to find:
1. "best cosmology podcasts 2025" / "cosmology podcasts 2026"
2. "latest cosmology discoveries 2025 2026"
3. Specific podcast names you find + their recent episodes
4. Cosmology news and debates that podcasts might be covering

### Phase 2: Deep Investigation
For each podcast you find:
- What's the podcast about?
- Who hosts it?
- What are their most recent episodes about?
- What cosmological topics are they covering?

### Phase 3: Trends
Across all podcasts, what themes emerge?
- Dark energy/dark matter updates?
- James Webb Space Telescope findings?
- Early universe discoveries?
- Alternative cosmological models?
- Tensions in cosmological measurements (Hubble tension etc.)?

### Phase 4: Export Your Full Thinking

When complete, save your findings as a ticket using the todos_oneshot tool:
- title: "Oracle 1: Cosmology podcasts research"
- description: Your FULL findings
- tags: "research,oracle"
- type: "task"

The ticket MUST include:
1. **Podcasts Found** - Name, host, description, URL if found
2. **Recent Episodes & Topics** - What each podcast has been discussing lately
3. **Hot Topics in Cosmology** - Emerging themes across podcasts
4. **Key Discoveries Being Discussed** - Specific scientific findings getting airtime
5. **Notable Guests/Interviews** - Any standout appearances
6. **Synthesis** - Overall landscape of cosmology podcast content right now

Be thorough. Use web search extensively. This is a research task.

## Notes

**2026-02-25T08:56:27Z**

Started research: gathering active cosmology podcasts and recent 2025-2026 episode topics from web sources.

**2026-02-25T08:59:46Z**

Progress: compiled 10 active podcasts via iTunes + RSS feeds, extracted 2025-2026 episode titles/dates, and mapped recurring cosmology topics (dark energy, Hubble tension, JWST, black holes, early universe). Drafting synthesis now.

**2026-02-25T09:00:35Z**

Created research artifact ticket p-f572 (Oracle 1: Cosmology podcasts research) with 10 active podcasts, 2025-2026 episode/topic analysis, hot-topic synthesis, discoveries discussed, and notable guest map.

**2026-02-25T09:00:38Z**

DONE: Completed Delphi Oracle #1 research. Used web search + podcast directory + RSS feed analysis to identify 10 active cosmology-relevant podcasts (2025-2026), summarized recent episodes/topics, extracted cross-show hot themes (dark energy, Hubble tension, JWST anomalies, dark matter, black-hole cosmology), logged notable guests, and published full findings as ticket p-f572 (tags: research,oracle).
