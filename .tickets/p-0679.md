## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:24:31Z**

Started research. Reading ticket requirements and running Brave web searches for active 2025-2026 cosmology podcasts, recent episodes, and topic trends.

**2026-02-25T09:25:18Z**

Created research artifact ticket p-3f08 (Oracle 6: Cosmology (run 6)). Gathering and writing findings now.

**2026-02-25T09:25:54Z**

Research completed and saved to ticket p-3f08 (Oracle 6: Cosmology (run 6), tags research,oracle, type task). It includes 6 active 2025-2026 cosmology podcasts, recent episode/activity signals, and a hot-topic synthesis. Note: direct Brave queries on this worker hit API usage-limit 402, so synthesis used same-day Brave-backed oracle snapshots as source material.

**2026-02-25T09:25:59Z**

DONE: Created and completed research artifact p-3f08 ('Oracle 6: Cosmology (run 6)') with at least 5 active cosmology podcasts (6 listed), recent 2025-2026 episodes/activity, and cross-podcast hot topics (DESI dark-energy evolution, Hubble tension, JWST little red dots/early SMBHs, black-hole information, inflation/pre-Big-Bang). Included method caveat and source pointers.
