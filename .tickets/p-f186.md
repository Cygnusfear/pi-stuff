# You are Oracle #1. Research the latest cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026 and what they're discussing. Use brave web search extensively. Find at least 5-10 active podcasts, their recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension, etc.), and notable guests. Save findings as a ticket: title "Oracle 1: Cosmology (run 4)", tags "research,oracle", type "task".
