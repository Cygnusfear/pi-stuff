# Oracle 2: Cosmology podcasts research (run 2)

Research window: Feb 2026 snapshot. I used Brave web search heavily, prioritized primary sources (official show pages, RSS feeds, Apple Podcasts listings), and then mapped episode recency + topic signals to current cosmology debates.

## 1) Podcasts Found (active in 2025-2026)

9. **The Infinite Monkey Cage** (BBC; Brian Cox + Robin Ince) [adjacent/general science but relevant episodes]  
   - Source surfaced: episode lists include space-focused topics in 2025.

10. **Why This Universe?** (not deeply validated in this run; mention as ecosystem context only)  
   - Not used as a core source due to weaker direct recency evidence in this pass.

## 2) Recent Episodes & Topics (2025-2026 signals)

### Ask a Spaceman (strong recency evidence)
- Feb 3, 2026: **“Does Antimatter Fall Up?”** (weak equivalence principle + CERN antimatter gravity tests).
- Dec 16, 2025: **“Does the Universe Have Extra Dimensions?”**
- Sep 23, 2025: **“What Can Gravitational Waves Teach Us About the Big Bang?”**
- Jul 8, 2025: **“Are the Cosmic Voids Really Empty?”**
- May 6, 2025: **“How Can We Get Giant Black Holes in the Early Universe?”**

### Astronomy Cast (strong recency evidence)
- Dec 22, 2025: **Matter–antimatter asymmetry**.
- Dec 15, 2025: **Hydrogen 21-cm line** (dark ages / structure mapping relevance).
- Sep 15, 2025: **Interstellar comets**.
- Jun 30, 2025: **Vera Rubin Observatory**.

### StarTalk (strong recency evidence)
- Dec 2025: **“Origins of Dark Energy with Adam Riess”** (dark energy history + Hubble tension + cosmic fate).
- Jan 2026: **“Cosmic Queries – Expanding Bubble Universes”** (multiverse/cosmology framing).

### Sean Carroll’s Mindscape (active cadence, cosmology intermittently heavy)
- Nov 2025: **Andrew Jaffe on models/probability and the universe**.
- May 2025: **Niayesh Afshordi + Phil Halper on the Big Bang and before**.
- Oct/Dec 2025 AMAs include cosmology questions: universe age definition, dark stars/JWST, early-universe decoherence.

### The Supermassive Podcast (strong recency evidence)
- Feb 11, 2026: **“2026: The year in space... And at sea?!”**
- Jan 29, 2026: **Q&A incl. nebula collisions, Uranus/Neptune formation, Artemis II context**.
- Dec 2025: **How to Time Travel** (relativity + causality popular framing).
- 2025 episodes include black-hole Q&A and space-weather related topics.

### Space Nuts (strong recency evidence)
- Jan/Feb 2026 episodes include **dark matter Q&A**, rogue planets, Mars caves, and JWST/early-universe news framing.
- 2025 episodes include hypervelocity stars, planetary classification boundaries, stellar/exoplanet extremes.

### Planetary Radio (broad but active)
- Jan 2026: **Voyager + heliopause** episode (edge of heliosphere/interstellar boundary).
- Late 2025 / early 2026: policy + science episodes where cosmology appears in context (JWST, Hubble tension mentions, deep-space missions).

### Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe
- 2025 listings show ongoing “listener questions/classic + core universe topics” model; useful for conceptual cosmology dissemination even where episode metadata is noisy across platforms.

## 3) Hot Topics in Cosmology across podcast coverage (2025-2026)

1. **Dark energy may be evolving** (vs strict cosmological constant) after DESI 3-year analyses when combined with CMB/SN/lensing constraints.
2. **Hubble tension remains unresolved** but is now discussed with more nuanced systematics + model-extension framing.
3. **JWST early-universe tension**: unexpectedly bright/compact/high-z galaxies, rapid enrichment, early structure formation.
4. **Early universe alternatives/extensions**: early dark energy, modified expansion histories, void/local-environment explanations.
5. **Dark matter candidate discourse broadening**: WIMPs still central, but PBH and dark-star narratives now receive more airtime.
6. **Gravitational-wave cosmology as tie-breaker**: listeners are increasingly exposed to how GW data can constrain early-universe models and black-hole formation channels.

## 4) Key Discoveries Being Discussed Right Now (with evidence)

- **DESI (Mar 2025):** strengthened hints that dark energy may evolve over cosmic time (not yet discovery-level significance, but repeated high-interest coverage potential).
- **JWST high-redshift galaxies (2025):** objects observed very early after Big Bang with unexpectedly high brightness/complexity, challenging simple growth timelines.
- **Hubble tension conference-level synthesis (2025):** still open; multiple independent probes now discussed together (H0, S8, etc.).
- **CMB-S4 project shutdown (July 2025):** major effect on near-future U.S.-led precision CMB roadmap; likely to shift podcast discussion toward “what now?” with existing instruments.
- **Dark-star candidate claims (late 2025 science-media cycle):** not consensus, but high public/podcast traction because it links dark matter + first stars + SMBH seeds.

## 5) Notable Guests / Interviews (seen in source sample)

- **Adam Riess on StarTalk** (dark energy, Hubble tension, cosmic expansion history).
- **Niayesh Afshordi + Phil Halper on Mindscape** (Big Bang/before-Big-Bang conceptual territory).
- **Royal Astronomical Society + mission/community guests on Supermassive** (e.g., astronomy meeting panels; practical mission implications).
- **Planetary Radio expert guests** (Voyager science leadership, policy analysts, mission scientists) connecting cosmology-adjacent discoveries to mission strategy.

## 6) Synthesis: current cosmology podcast landscape (2025-2026)

- The ecosystem is **very active** and splits into two lanes:
  1) **Dedicated explainers** (Ask a Spaceman, Astronomy Cast, Daniel/Jorge) that turn hard cosmology into structured episodes.
  2) **Interview/news hybrids** (StarTalk, Mindscape, Supermassive, Space Nuts, Planetary Radio) that rapidly absorb emerging papers, telescope results, and debate narratives.

- The dominant editorial pattern is not “new settled discoveries,” but **high-signal uncertainty management**:
  - DESI hints vs discovery threshold,
  - JWST surprises vs model adjustments,
  - Hubble tension persistence vs possible systematics/new physics.

- In practice, the hottest 2025-2026 cosmology audio content is about **where ΛCDM strains are strongest** and which incoming data streams (JWST, DESI extensions, GW cosmology, revised CMB strategy) can discriminate between competing explanations.

## Methods / confidence notes

- I prioritized direct show pages and RSS where possible (best for recency and exact titles).
- Some platforms (Apple/aggregators) mix “classic” and “new” entries and can produce metadata ambiguity.
- Confidence is highest for podcasts with direct RSS/official episode pages in this run (Ask a Spaceman, Astronomy Cast, Supermassive, StarTalk archive, Mindscape, Planetary Radio).
