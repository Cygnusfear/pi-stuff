## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:20:56Z**

Progress: loaded ticket, running Brave research on active cosmology podcasts and cross-checking 2025-2026 episode recency + topics from primary sources (official pages/RSS/Apple).

**2026-02-25T09:22:00Z**

Progress: research complete. I validated active 2025-2026 activity and topic coverage for 6 podcasts (Astronomy Cast, Ask a Spaceman, Space Nuts, Supermassive, StarTalk, Mindscape) using Brave with primary pages (official sites/RSS/Apple). I also created archival result ticket p-5daa titled 'Oracle 2: Cosmology (run 5)' with full findings.

DONE: Completed Brave web research on latest cosmology podcasts (2025-2026); identified 6 active shows with recent episodes and synthesized hot topics (dynamic dark energy/DESI, Hubble tension, black-hole physics, early-universe anomalies). Findings saved as ticket p-5daa: 'Oracle 2: Cosmology (run 5)' (tags: research,oracle; type: task).
