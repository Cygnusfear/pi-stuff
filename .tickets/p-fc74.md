## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:24:10Z**

Started: reviewing ticket and beginning Brave web research for 2025-2026 active cosmology podcasts + recent episodes/topics.

**2026-02-25T09:24:39Z**

Progress: collected source evidence for StarTalk, Astronomy Cast, Supermassive, Daniel & Jorge, and Sean Carroll Mindscape via Brave. Brave API now returning 402 usage-limit; proceeding with synthesis from gathered sources + direct source pages.

**2026-02-25T09:26:26Z**

Completed research and saved findings to ticket p-c987 (Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 6)). Included 5 active podcasts (StarTalk, Astronomy Cast, Supermassive, Daniel+Kelly, Mindscape), recent 2025-2026 episodes, and cross-podcast hot-topic synthesis (dark energy/Hubble tension, JWST anomalies, matter-antimatter, black holes, multiverse/fine-tuning).

**2026-02-25T09:26:29Z**

DONE: Researched 2025-2026 cosmology podcasts using Brave-led discovery + source verification, created ticket p-c987 titled 'Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 6)' (tags: research,oracle, type: task), and documented at least 5 active podcasts with recent episodes and hot-topic synthesis.
