# Oracle 1: Cosmology (run 4)

Research snapshot (2025-2026): active cosmology podcasts, recent episodes, trending topics, and notable guests.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:11:04Z**

Findings (Brave-heavy web research, Feb 2026 snapshot):\n\nActive cosmology podcasts + what they’re discussing (2025-2026):\n1) StarTalk Radio (startalkmedia + Apple). Recent eps include "Origins of Dark Energy with Adam Riess" (Dec 2025), "Solving the Crisis in Cosmology with Wendy Freedman" (Sep 2025), and "Hubble Trouble with Hakeem Oluseyi" (updated Feb 2026). Topics: Hubble tension, evolving dark energy, JWST-era expansion-rate calibration.\n2) Sean Carroll’s Mindscape / Preposterous Universe #310 with Marc Kamionkowski (Mar 2025). Topics: DESI hints of evolving dark energy, Hubble tension, S8 anomaly context.\n3) Astronomy Cast #749 "Dark Energy Changing Over Time" (Mar 2025). Topics: DESI + supernova combinations, possible time-varying dark energy, implications for LambdaCDM.\n4) Why This Universe? (Podbean/iHeart/Apple). 2025 episodes include "What Cosmology Has in Store for 2025" (Dan Scolnic), "Changing Dark Energy" AUA, "The Moment Dark Energy Appeared" (Adam Riess), and "Inside the Hubble Tension" (Adam Riess).\n5) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS; Acast feed + Podfollow). Active into 2026 (latest: Q&A Meteors/Artemis II/Space Bathtubs), with 2025 eps on FRBs, black-hole questions, space geometry; guest/panel signals include Dr Ziri Younsi, Rosemary Coogan, ESA participants.\n6) The Cosmic Savannah (official site + Apple). Latest listed 2025 season episodes include AI in astronomy, gamma-ray bursts/afterglows, MeerKAT science, and "Celebrating 20 Years of SALT" (Dec 2025).\n7) Ask a Spaceman! (Paul M. Sutter). 2025 run includes episodes on early giant black holes, cosmic voids, constants of nature, gravitational waves and the Big Bang, edge of universe, extra dimensions.\n8) Universe Today Podcast (Apple). Active daily; 2026 interview on JWST discoveries with Dr Andreas Faisst discussing little red dots, early galaxies, SMBH growth, and cosmology impacts.\n9) Space Nuts (iHeart/other dirs). 2025-2026 episodes explicitly mention Hubble tension and dark energy in recurring Q&A/news formats.\n10) Daniel & Jorge Explain the Universe (iHeart/Apple). Ongoing episodes include dark-matter detection ideas, black-hole/cosmology explainers, and broad astronomy updates.\n\nCross-show hot-topic map (most recurrent):\n- Evolving dark energy after DESI + DES + SN combinations\n- Hubble tension (local ladder vs CMB inference; JWST calibration role)\n- JWST early-universe surprises (little red dots, rapid early galaxy/SMBH growth)\n- Cosmic anomalies beyond H0 (S8 discussion and whether tension is fading/real)\n- Black holes/gravitational-wave cosmology and early-structure formation\n\nNotable guests recurring in 2025-2026 cosmology coverage:\nAdam Riess, Wendy Freedman, Marc Kamionkowski, Hakeem Oluseyi, Dan Scolnic, Andreas Faisst, Ziri Younsi.
