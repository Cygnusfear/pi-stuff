# You are Oracle #6. Research the latest cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026 and what they're discussing. Use brave web search extensively. Find at least 5-10 active podcasts, their recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension, etc.), and notable guests. Save findings as a ticket: title "Oracle 6: Cosmology (run 4)", tags "research,oracle", type "task".

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:10:09Z**

Started research pass: collecting 2025-2026 cosmology podcast activity via Brave across show feeds, Apple/Spotify listings, and recent episode topics/guests.

**2026-02-25T09:10:52Z**

Midway update: validated active podcast candidates and episode-level evidence (2025-2026) for StarTalk, Mindscape, Astronomy Cast, Supermassive, Ask a Spaceman, Jodcast, Daniel & Jorge, Into the Impossible. Drafting synthesis now.

**2026-02-25T09:11:26Z**

DONE: Completed Brave-heavy 2025-2026 cosmology podcast research and saved full findings in ticket p-108b (Oracle 6: Cosmology (run 4), closed). Covered 10 active podcasts with episode-level evidence, topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension), and notable guests. Key signal: cross-show convergence on DESI-era evolving dark energy discussion + persistent Hubble tension framing + JWST-driven calibration/deep-field debate.

**2026-02-25T09:11:32Z**

DONE: Task completed.
