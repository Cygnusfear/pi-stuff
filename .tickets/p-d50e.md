# You are Oracle #3. Research the latest cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026 and what they're discussing. Use brave web search extensively. Find at least 5-10 active podcasts, their recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension, etc.), and notable guests. Save findings as a ticket: title "Oracle 3: Cosmology (run 4)", tags "research,oracle", type "task".

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:10:04Z**

Started: reviewing scope and collecting 2025-2026 cosmology podcast sources via Brave (shows, episode recency, topics, guests).

**2026-02-25T09:10:48Z**

Progress: compiled sources for active 2025-2026 cosmology-heavy podcasts and episode-level evidence (DESI/dark energy evolution, Hubble tension, JWST-era cosmology, early-universe puzzles, black holes). Drafting final synthesis + podcast list now.

**2026-02-25T09:11:23Z**

DONE: Completed Brave-heavy research on latest cosmology podcasts (2025-2026) and what they are discussing. Identified and synthesized 8 active shows with recent episode evidence, hot topics (DESI/dark-energy evolution, Hubble tension, JWST-era anomalies, cosmological horizons/early-universe structure), and notable guests. Saved full findings in ticket p-7ce6 ('Oracle 3: Cosmology (run 4)') and closed it.

**2026-02-25T09:11:38Z**

DONE: Task completed.
