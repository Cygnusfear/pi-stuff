## Notes

**2026-02-13T05:42:46Z**

DONE: Created extensions/teams/WORKER_LIFECYCLE.md documenting the full worker lifecycle from spawn to completion, including all 5 worker states (spawning→running→done/failed/killed), all ticket interactions (create, start, show, add-note, close), poll events, cleanup steps, and a sequence diagram.
