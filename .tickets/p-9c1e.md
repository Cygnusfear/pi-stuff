# Oracle 5: Cosmology (run 4)

Research latest cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026 and what they discuss; include active shows, recent episodes, hot topics, and notable guests.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:11:23Z**

Research snapshot (Feb 2026, Brave-heavy): 9 active cosmology-forward podcasts + what they are discussing. (1) Astronomy Cast (Fraser Cain, Pamela Gay) active weekly through 2025-2026; notable episodes include Ep. 749 'Dark Energy Changing Over Time' (Mar 2025), Ep. 751 'Vacuum Energy' (Apr 2025), and late-2025 cosmology episodes like matter/antimatter asymmetry and 21-cm line; core topics: DESI evolving dark energy hints, Hubble-tension implications, early-universe probes. (2) Why This Universe (Dan Hooper, Shalma Wegsman) with explicit 2025 cosmology forecasts + deep dark-energy coverage; key episodes: 'What Cosmology Has in Store for 2025' (ft Dan Scolnic), 'The Moment Dark Energy Appeared' (ft Adam Riess), 'Inside the Hubble Tension' (ft Adam Riess); topics: H0 crisis framing, cosmological model stress-testing, near-term survey expectations. (3) Sean Carroll's Mindscape: Ep. 310 (Mar 2025) with Marc Kamionkowski on dark energy + cosmic anomalies and Hubble tension; ongoing model-comparison and anomaly interpretation across 2025 episodes. (4) StarTalk: Dec 2025 episode 'Origins of Dark Energy' with Nobel laureate Adam Riess; public-facing discussion of dark energy discovery history, Hubble tension, and universe fate scenarios. (5) Ask a Spaceman (Paul M. Sutter) active through Dec 2025 with cosmology episodes such as 'Where Exactly is the Edge of the Universe?', 'What Can Gravitational Waves Teach Us About the Big Bang?', 'Are the Cosmic Voids Really Empty?'; themes: cosmic horizons, early-universe signals, structure growth. (6) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS; Izzie Clarke, Dr Becky Smethurst, Dr Robert Massey) active through late 2025 with episodes on black-hole/cosmology questions, dark skies, and JWST-era interpretation; notable guests include Rosemary Coogan, Ziri Younsi, Tim Peake, plus expert discussants on observational constraints. (7) The Joy of Why (Quanta; Janna Levin/Steven Strogatz) biweekly in 2025; cosmology standout: 'Why Did the Universe Begin?' with Thomas Hertog (Hawking collaboration); topics: Big Bang initial-condition theories, multiverse skepticism, cosmological natural selection framing. (8) Into the Impossible (Brian Keating) active 2025 with high-volume cosmology interviews; episodes include random-vs-deterministic universe discussions and repeated Hubble/dark-energy debate with cosmology guests (e.g., Andrew Jaffe, crossovers on dark energy and early-universe tensions). (9) Universe Today Podcast (Fraser Cain) active with regular cosmology Q&As/interviews (e.g., direct-collapse SMBH candidate 'Infinity Galaxy', JWST/cosmology update interviews); themes: early SMBH growth, little-red-dots interpretation, cosmological expansion questions. Cross-show hot-topic map (2025-2026): strongest convergence on evolving dark energy (DESI-led), Hubble tension as possible model crisis vs systematics, JWST little-red-dots/early SMBH formation pathways, Rubin/next-survey anticipation, and renewed discussions of early-universe initial conditions. Notable recurring guests across ecosystem: Adam Riess, Dan Scolnic, Marc Kamionkowski, Thomas Hertog, plus science communicators/astronomers (Pamela Gay, Paul Sutter, Becky Smethurst, Fraser Cain). Source preference used: official show feeds/pages and major platform mirrors (Acast/Libsyn/official show pages/Apple listings).

DONE: Research findings captured with 9 active podcasts (2025-2026), recent episodes, hot-topic synthesis (dark energy, Hubble tension, JWST/LRDs, early SMBH growth), and notable guests.
