# Oracle 5: Cosmology (run 6)

Brave web research snapshot (Feb 2026) on active cosmology podcasts and current discussion themes in 2025-2026. Includes at least 5 active podcasts, recent episodes, and hot-topic synthesis.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:24:50Z**

Findings (Brave web search, Feb 2026): identified active cosmology-focused podcasts with 2025-2026 episode recency from primary listings (Apple Podcasts, official RSS/show feeds, iHeart/show pages).

**2026-02-25T09:24:53Z**

1) Universe Today Podcast (Fraser Cain) - active in 2026 with very recent episodes (Apple shows 2-4 days ago). Recent titles include '[Space Bites+] AMATERASU Cosmic Rays // Late Heavy Bombardment Doubts // Titan Bully' and JWST-focused interview episodes. Topics: Hubble tension, dark energy survey results, JWST cosmology stress tests, early SMBHs/little red dots, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

2) The Supermassive Podcast (Royal Astronomical Society / Boffin Media) - active in 2026. Apple listing shows Jan 29, 2026 episode 'Q&A: Meteors, Artemis II, and Space Bathtubs' plus Dec 2025 '2026: The year in space...'. Topics: multiverse/time-travel public cosmology, planetary formation, nebulae, Artemis II and near-term mission context.

**2026-02-25T09:25:01Z**

3) Astronomy Cast (Fraser Cain + Pamela Gay) - active through late 2025 via RSS and platform listings. Cosmology-heavy episodes include Ep. 749 'Dark Energy Changing Over Time' (Mar 2025), Ep. 751 'Vacuum Energy' (Apr 2025), Ep. 755 'Intermediate Mass Black Holes' (May 2025), Ep. 763 'Interstellar Comets' (Sep 2025). Topics: Hubble tension, evolving dark energy, black hole growth channels, cosmology-adjacent survey interpretation.

**2026-02-25T09:25:04Z**

4) Ask a Spaceman! (Paul M. Sutter) - active with frequent 2025 episodes through Dec 2025. Examples: AaS 256 'What Can Gravitational Waves Teach Us About the Big Bang?' (Sep 23, 2025), AaS 259 'Where Exactly is the Edge of the Universe?' (Nov 4, 2025), AaS 262 'Does the Universe Have Extra Dimensions?' (Dec 16, 2025). Topics: inflation-era gravitational waves, cosmic horizons, constants of nature, early giant black holes.

**2026-02-25T09:25:08Z**

5) StarTalk Radio (Neil deGrasse Tyson) - active in 2026 with fresh Jan-Feb episodes. Recent examples: 'Cosmic Queries – Black Hole Information Paradox' (Jan 27, 2026) and 'Return to Venus with David Grinspoon' (Feb 3, 2026). Topics: black hole information paradox, wormholes/black-hole-universe ideas, Venus habitability and astrobiology in broader cosmology framing. Sources: iheart.com/podcast/81-startalk-radio-20633896 and podcasts.apple.com/ae/podcast/startalk-radio/id325404506.

**2026-02-25T09:25:13Z**

Cross-podcast hot-topic convergence (2025-2026): (a) Hubble tension and whether dark energy evolves with time, (b) JWST-era cosmology pressure tests (early galaxies/little red dots/SMBH timelines), (c) black hole theory (information paradox + rapid early growth), (d) inflation and primordial signals (gravitational-wave links), (e) cosmology-public interface through Artemis/Venus/mission-era framing.
