## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:20:42Z**

Started: reviewing ticket scope and gathering 2025-2026 cosmology podcast sources via Brave.

**2026-02-25T09:21:29Z**

Progress: collected primary-source evidence from podcast show pages/Apple/RSS for active 2025-2026 cosmology shows; now synthesizing recency + topic trends.

DONE: Researched latest cosmology podcasts (2025-2026) via Brave and identified active shows, recent episodes, and hot topics.\n\nFindings (active podcasts + recent evidence):\n1) StarTalk Radio (Neil deGrasse Tyson)\n- Evidence: Apple Podcasts shows years active through 2026 and new episodes Tuesdays.\n- Recent episodes/topics: 'Is the Universe a Math Problem?' (Feb 2026), 'Hubble Trouble' (updated Feb 2026), 'Solving the Crisis in Cosmology with Wendy Freedman' (late 2025).\n- Cosmology themes: Hubble tension, dark energy, dark matter, universe expansion, JWST interpretation.\n\n2) Astronomy Cast (Fraser Cain + Dr. Pamela Gay)\n- Evidence: Apple listing says updated weekly; Feb 2026 episodes #781/#782 visible.\n- Recent episodes/topics: 'Awakening Black Holes' (Feb 2026), 'Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients' (Feb 2026), plus late-2025 episodes on antimatter asymmetry and early-universe probes.\n- Cosmology themes: dark matter constraints, transients, early-universe structure formation, black-hole growth.\n\n3) Into the Impossible (Brian Keating)\n- Evidence: Apple listing shows years active 2016-2026 and 2026 episode feed.\n- Recent episodes/topics: 'Is the Universe Random or Deterministic?' (Jan 2026, with Andrew Jaffe), discussions of inflation stress tests, model uncertainty, and Hubble tension.\n- Cosmology themes: epistemology of cosmology, inflation viability, probabilistic inference in cosmological models.\n\n4) Space Nuts: Astronomy Insights & Cosmic Discoveries\n- Evidence: show pages/iHeart/spacenutspodcast list Jan-Feb 2026 episodes and twice-weekly cadence.\n- Recent episodes/topics: 'Solar Secrets...' (Feb 2026), 'Black Hole Temperatures, Cosmic Mapping & the Mystery of Dark Matter' (Jan 2026), 'Artemis 2, Wormholes, and Einstein Crosses' (2026 run).\n- Cosmology themes: dark matter interpretation, gravitational waves/wormholes, cosmological lensing, black-hole physics.\n\n5) The Supermassive Podcast (Royal Astronomical Society)\n- Evidence: Podfollow + RSS entries confirm Jan-Feb 2026 episodes.\n- Recent episodes/topics: '2026: The year in space...' (Feb 2026), 'Q&A: Meteors, Artemis II, and Space Bathtubs' (Jan 2026), late-2025 episodes on time travel and gravitational-wave style questions.\n- Cosmology themes: large-scale universe questions in public outreach format, mission-driven context (Artemis II), relativity/time concepts.\n\n6) Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe (iHeart)\n- Evidence: Apple/Spotify show pages with 2026 copyright and very large active catalog; Podbean mirror shows Jan 2026 episode cadence.\n- Recent episodes/topics: 'The several styles of singularities' (Jan 2026), 'What's the densest thing in the Universe that's not a black hole?' (Dec 2025), 'What came before the Big Bang?' recirculated classic.\n- Cosmology themes: singularities, compact objects, early-universe origin questions.\n\nCross-podcast hot topics in 2025-2026:\n- Hubble tension and whether it implies new physics vs measurement systematics.\n- Dark energy evolution and competing cosmological-model updates.\n- Dark matter constraints via lensing, galaxy structure, and black-hole environment observations.\n- JWST-era anomalies/interpretations (high-z galaxies, structure timing, model stress tests).\n- Black holes/singularities/transients as practical tests of cosmological models.\n- Artemis II and mission-era astronomy as a bridge between public space coverage and cosmology explainers.\n\nMethod note: prioritized Brave results from primary show pages, Apple Podcasts metadata, and direct RSS/feed snapshots; used list/ranking sites only as discovery aids.
