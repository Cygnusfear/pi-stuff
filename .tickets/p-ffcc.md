# Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 5)

Brave web research snapshot (Feb 2026) on active cosmology podcasts and current discussion themes in 2025-2026. Includes at least 5 active podcasts with recent episodes and hot-topic synthesis.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:21:32Z**

Findings (Brave web search, Feb 2026):

1) Universe Today Podcast (Apple listing updated ~2-4 days ago)
- Recent: "[Space Bites+] AMATERASU Cosmic Rays // Late Heavy Bombardment Doubts // Titan Bully" (2d ago), plus black hole/cosmological redshift Q&A topics.
- Hot topics: ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, lunar bombardment history, Saturn/Titan origin scenarios, JWST constraints, interstellar object interception concepts.
- Sources: Apple Podcasts listing + Universe Today-linked episode notes in result snippets.

2) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS/Boffin Media)
- Recent: "Q&A: Meteors, Artemis II, and Space Bathtubs" (Jan 2026), plus 2025 episodes (shape of space, black-hole questions, time, gravity).
- Hot topics: cosmological structure, black holes, multiverse/time-travel framing, space weather, Artemis-era exploration.
- Sources: Apple Podcasts + Acast feed excerpts + podfollow.

3) Ask a Spaceman! (Paul M. Sutter)
- Recent 2025 run includes: edge of universe, extra dimensions, gravitational waves and the Big Bang, cosmic voids, early giant black holes.
- Hot topics: cosmic horizons, inflation signatures, vacuum energy, early-universe black-hole growth, constants of nature.
- Sources: Apple Podcasts listing + indexed episode timeline pages surfaced by Brave.

4) Astronomy Cast (Fraser Cain + Pamela Gay)
- Active through late 2025/early 2026 (Apple + RSS evidence).
- Recent cosmology-heavy episodes: #776 matter-antimatter dichotomy (Dec 2025), #749 dark energy changing over time; adjacent episodes on dark ages probes and interstellar/comological implications.
- Hot topics: Hubble tension, evolving dark-energy possibility, baryogenesis, dark-era mapping, cosmology through survey instrumentation.
- Sources: AstronomyCast RSS + show site episode pages + Apple Podcasts listing.

5) StarTalk Radio (Neil deGrasse Tyson)
- Active with Feb 2026 episodes on quantum consciousness, black-hole information paradox, cosmic-queries sessions including Sean Carroll.
- Hot topics: black-hole information, quantum foundations, cosmological constant, speculative cosmology and multiverse-adjacent listener queries.
- Sources: Apple Podcasts + iHeart + StarTalk media episode pages.

6) Sean Carroll's Mindscape (physics-adjacent, often cosmology-focused episodes/AMAs)
- Active weekly into Feb 2026; recent items include "Being Rational in a Very Large Universe" and 2025 episodes on Big Bang/early-universe ideas.
- Hot topics: anthropic reasoning, cosmological uncertainty, pre-Big-Bang discussion, inflation/rest-frame conceptual questions.
- Sources: Mindscape official page + Apple Podcasts.

7) Why This Universe? (Dan Hooper & Shalma Wegsman)
- Active through late 2025 (series appears paused/less frequent by early 2026, but still latest 2025 cosmology content).
- Recent: "Inside the Hubble Tension" and episodes on evolving dark energy + neutrino/cosmology implications.
- Hot topics: Hubble tension, dark-energy dynamics, observational anomalies vs standard model interpretation.
- Sources: iHeart + Apple Podcasts listing.

Cross-podcast 2025-2026 hot-topic convergence:
- Hubble tension and whether dark energy evolves with time
- Black holes (information paradox, early SMBH growth, singularity/quantum-gravity framing)
- Early-universe probes (gravitational waves, baryogenesis, inflation-era signatures)
- JWST-era cosmology stress tests (galaxy formation timelines, high-z interpretation debates)
- Artemis/lunar-planetary program links feeding back into cosmology-adjacent discussion

Method note:
- Prioritized primary pages (Apple listings, official show pages, and RSS/feed excerpts) over ranking/listicle sources; used listicles only for discovery and then validated against primary episode/feed evidence.
