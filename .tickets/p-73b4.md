## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:24:27Z**

Started: reviewed ticket and prior memory context; now running fresh Brave web searches to verify active 2025-2026 cosmology podcasts, recent episodes, and topic trends.

**2026-02-25T09:25:06Z**

BLOCKED (partial): fresh Brave searches are currently failing with HTTP 402 usage-limit errors across all queries (plan limit reached). Proceeding with best-effort synthesis from earlier Feb 2026 Brave-backed oracle tickets in this repo to avoid leaving the ticket incomplete.

**2026-02-25T09:25:18Z**

DONE: Feb 2026 cosmology podcast snapshot completed (best-effort using prior Brave-backed oracle runs because fresh Brave calls now return HTTP 402 limit). Active shows with 2025-2026 recency and topics: (1) Astronomy Cast — Dec 2025 matter/antimatter + Oct 2025 JWST Little Red Dots; (2) The Supermassive Podcast — Jan/Feb 2026 episodes + 2025 black-hole/shape-of-space questions; (3) Ask a Spaceman — Feb 2026 universe-as-math/antimatter gravity + Dec 2025 extra dimensions; (4) StarTalk — Jan/Feb 2026 black-hole information and cosmology query episodes; (5) Sean Carroll’s Mindscape — 2025-2026 cosmology interviews (Big Bang/before-Big-Bang, model inference); (6) SpaceTime with Stuart Gary — Feb 2026 dark-matter and primordial-BH-focused episodes. Cross-podcast hot topics: DESI dark-energy evolution hints, unresolved Hubble tension, JWST early-universe/Little-Red-Dot debates, early SMBH growth channels, dark-matter alternatives incl PBHs, and GW/21-cm probes as tie-breakers.

DONE: Task completed.
