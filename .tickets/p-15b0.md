# Add per-worker model selection to teams

Allow specifying a model per worker task in the teams tool, e.g. { text, assignee, model: "openai/gpt-5.3-codex" }. Thread model through SpawnConfig → spawner → pi CLI --model flag.



## Goal
Enable per-worker model selection so different team agents can use different LLM providers/models.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task schema accepts optional `model` field
- [ ] SpawnConfig and WorkerHandle carry model info
- [ ] spawner passes --model flag to pi CLI when model is specified
- [ ] Widget shows model name next to worker info
- [ ] /team delegate command supports model syntax
- [ ] Tool description documents model field

## Verification
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Tool schema includes model parameter
- [ ] spawner builds correct CLI args with --model

## Worktree
- .
