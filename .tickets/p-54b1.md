# Oracle 2: Cosmology podcasts (run 3)

Research window: Feb 2026 snapshot. Focused on currently active shows with evidence from official feeds/show pages and major podcast directories (Apple Podcasts, iHeart, show RSS/official sites).

Top active podcasts covering cosmology in 2025-2026

1) StarTalk Radio (Neil deGrasse Tyson)
- Evidence of current activity: Apple listing says updated weekly in 2026; Feb 2026 episodes on StarTalk archives.
- Recent cosmology topics:
  - "Is the Universe a Math Problem?" with Terence Tao (dark matter + math of cosmology)
  - "Black Hole Information Paradox"
  - "Expanding Bubble Universes"
  - Episodes around Hubble tension / “crisis in cosmology” with Wendy Freedman.
- Signal: keeps cosmology visible in mainstream science media while mixing rigorous guest interviews and public Q&A.

2) The Supermassive Podcast (Royal Astronomical Society)
- Evidence of current activity: Acast feed includes Jan-Feb 2026 episodes.
- Recent topics:
  - Artemis II implications for lunar/space science
  - multiverse and time-travel explainers
  - gravitational waves and extreme space weather Q&A
  - planetary formation questions (where Uranus/Neptune formed).
- Signal: strong bridge between pro astronomy and educated public audience.

3) Astronomy Cast (Fraser Cain + Pamela Gay)
- Evidence of activity: Apple + show pages list Jan-Feb 2026 episodes (e.g., Ep 780, Ep 782).
- Recent topics relevant to cosmology:
  - transient universe (Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients)
  - black-hole awakening/feeding episodes
  - matter-antimatter asymmetry discussions (late 2025)
  - long-timescale planetary/climate cycles and impact risk.
- Signal: steady, long-running explanatory show with direct tie-in to current astronomy papers.

4) Ask a Spaceman! (Paul M. Sutter)
- Evidence: official pmsutter.com show page shows Jan-Feb 2026 episodes (e.g., #263-265), Apple pages show 2026 updates.
- Recent cosmology-adjacent topics:
  - gravitational waves and what they reveal about inflation/early universe
  - hypothetical particles and beyond-standard-model ideas.
- Signal: question-driven format tracks what listeners most want explained in frontier physics/cosmology.

5) Universe Today Podcast (Fraser Cain)
- Evidence: Apple + feed snapshots show frequent Feb 2026 episodes.
- Recent cosmology topics:
  - “Everything You Need to Know About JWST’s Discoveries in 2026” (early galaxy growth, little red dots, SMBH role)
  - Dark Energy Survey updates and expansion-rate tension context
  - Vera Rubin era expectations, magnetars/black-hole formation interviews.
- Signal: one of the fastest-turnaround formats for cosmology news interpretation.

6) SpaceTime with Stuart Gary
- Evidence: official site + iHeart pages show Jan-Feb 2026 releases.
- Recent cosmology topics:
  - dark matter-neutrino interaction claims/discussion
  - ancient supernova constraints on dark energy
  - dwarf-galaxy + dark-matter modeling updates.
- Signal: high-frequency headline podcast useful for tracking near-real-time claims.

7) Sean Carroll’s Mindscape
- Evidence: active through Feb 2026 (official site + Apple pages).
- Recent cosmology-relevant episodes:
  - large-universe reasoning/probability (anthropic and observer issues)
  - recurring dark energy / cosmological anomaly guests in 2025-2026 (e.g., Marc Kamionkowski discussion in 2025 archive).
- Signal: deeper theory/philosophy framing around active cosmology tensions.

8) Big Picture Science
- Evidence: active 2025-2026 (Apple/iHeart + episode pages).
- Recent cosmology topics:
  - “Beyond the Standard Model” (dark matter/dark energy as missing pieces)
  - “Scoping Out the Universe” (new telescope era, FRB mysteries).
- Signal: broad science show but with frequent cosmology segments tied to observatory advances.

9) Why This Universe?
- Evidence: active into Jan 2026 via Buzzsprout + mirrors.
- Recent relevant topics:
  - “What Cosmology Has in Store for 2025”
  - Hubble tension deep dives (with Adam Riess)
  - changing-dark-energy / quintessence episodes.
- Signal: one of the clearest public explainers of active theoretical disputes in cosmology.

10) The Joy of Why (Quanta)
- Evidence: active through 2025 with season-4 cosmology episodes still circulating in 2026 recommendations.
- Key topic episode:
  - “Why Did the Universe Begin?” (Thomas Hertog on Hawking collaboration, alternatives to naive multiverse framing).
- Signal: high-quality conceptual/theoretical framing, even when not weekly-cosmology-only.

Most-discussed cosmology topics across shows (2025-2026)

A) The Hubble tension remains central
- Multiple podcasts discuss whether disagreement between early-universe and late-universe expansion measurements reflects systematics vs new physics.
- Guests linked to this debate (e.g., Adam Riess, Wendy Freedman, Sean Carroll contexts).

B) Dark energy may be dynamic, not constant
- Strong spillover from DESI-era reporting into podcast episodes.
- The core question: is Lambda-CDM incomplete because dark energy evolves over cosmic time?

C) JWST-driven early-universe surprises
- “Little red dots,” unexpectedly mature early galaxies, and rapid SMBH growth appear repeatedly.
- Podcasts frame this as either model stress-test or expected complexity now becoming measurable.

D) Dark matter model diversification
- Beyond classic cold-dark-matter framing: warm/wave/self-interacting possibilities, interaction channels (including neutrino-linked speculation) and dark-sector phenomenology.

E) Gravitational-wave cosmology broadening
- Not only compact-binary astrophysics: shows increasingly discuss early-universe GW backgrounds and information about inflation/phase transitions.

F) Cosmology-public interface is shifting
- More podcasts now blend hard cosmology with mission-roadmap context (Artemis II, Roman, Rubin, JWST follow-up), making “what the data pipeline can test next” a main theme.

Emerging trends/debates to watch in 2026

1. “Crisis” framing is now mainstream but nuanced:
   - Many hosts stress that tensions may indicate either new physics or underestimated systematics.

2. Observatory triangulation is the dominant method story:
   - JWST + DESI + ACT/CMB + Rubin/future Roman are increasingly discussed as complementary arbiters.

3. Faster cycle from paper/preprint to public discourse:
   - High-frequency podcasts (Universe Today, SpaceTime, StarTalk specials) are accelerating interpretation speed, which increases both public engagement and misinterpretation risk.

4. Cosmology + philosophy crossover is growing:
   - Shows like Mindscape/Why This Universe put observer selection, multiverse logic, and inference limits directly into mainstream conversation.

Bottom line
- There is no single “new cosmology podcast winner” in 2026; instead, a cluster of highly active shows jointly define the conversation.
- The hottest podcast-level cosmology conversation is the three-way intersection of: (i) Hubble/expansion-rate tensions, (ii) potential time-evolving dark energy, and (iii) JWST early-universe anomalies (little red dots / rapid SMBH growth).
- If this pattern holds through late 2026, expect podcast coverage to pivot from “is Lambda-CDM in trouble?” to “which specific extensions survive cross-observatory tests?”
