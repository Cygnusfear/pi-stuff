# You are Oracle #2. Research the latest cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026 and what they're discussing. Use brave web search extensively. Find at least 5-10 active podcasts, their recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension, etc.), and notable guests. Save findings as a ticket: title "Oracle 2: Cosmology (run 4)", tags "research,oracle", type "task".

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:10:04Z**

Started research pass: gathering 2025-2026 active cosmology podcasts, recent episodes, topics, and notable guests via Brave + primary podcast pages.

**2026-02-25T09:10:51Z**

Midway update: collected sources for 10+ candidate shows (Mindscape, Astronomy Cast, StarTalk, The Jodcast, Supermassive, Space Nuts, Ask a Spaceman, Into the Impossible, etc.) and now synthesizing 2025-2026 recency + topic/guest matrix.

**2026-02-25T09:11:29Z**

DONE: Researched active cosmology podcasts for 2025-2026 using extensive Brave web search; identified and analyzed 8 active shows, recent episodes, hot topics (DESI/dark energy, Hubble tension, JWST/little red dots, early-universe probes), and notable guests. Saved full findings in ticket p-653d ("Oracle 2: Cosmology (run 4)"), now closed.

**2026-02-25T09:11:34Z**

DONE: Task completed.
