## Notes

**2026-02-13T05:32:25Z**

DONE: Research complete. Here's a summary of findings:

## 1. can1357/oh-my-pi (Can Bölük)
A **fork of badlogic/pi-mono** (82 stars, MIT, TypeScript+Rust). Key additions beyond upstream pi:
- **Subagents plugin** (`@oh-my-pi/subagents` on npm): Task delegation system with 5 specialized agents: `task` (general), `planner` (architect), `explore` (read-only scout), `reviewer` (code review), `browser` (URL fetcher). Parallel execution with real-time artifact streaming. Reviewer can spawn explore agents.
- **Hashline**: Appears to be integrated (referenced in context of file editing tools)
- **Plugin/MCP system**: Full plugin CLI (`omp plugin install/enable/configure/doctor`), hot-loadable plugins from `~/.omp/plugins/`, MCP support with stdio/HTTP transports
- **Other additions**: `omp commit` (AI git commits), `omp jupyter`, oclif-based CLI, git worktree isolation for subagents (`task.isolation.enabled` setting)

## 2. mitsuhiko/agent-stuff (Armin Ronacher)
618+ stars, Apache-2.0. **NOT a fork** — it's a collection of skills, extensions, and commands used with pi/Claude. Contains:
- **Skills**: commit, update-changelog, ghidra (reverse engineering), github (gh CLI), openscad (3D models), web-browser (CDP/Puppeteer), tmux, sentry, pi-share (session transcript loader), anachb/oebb-scotty (Austrian transport APIs), frontend-design
- **Pi extensions** folder and **pi-themes** folder
- The web-browser skill description says "License: Stolen from Mario" — indicating it originated from pi-mono
- Published on npm as `mitsupi` for use with pi's package loader

## 3. anomalyco/opencode
**103K stars**, MIT, TypeScript. "The open source coding agent" — a major standalone project (NOT a pi fork). Features:
- Desktop app + TUI + CLI
- 15+ provider support
- Has a **task/subagent system** — there's an open PR (#7756) adding subagent-to-subagent delegation with budgets, persistent sessions, and hierarchical session navigation
- References to "oh-my-opencode" (similar to oh-my-pi pattern)
- Pi may have taken inspiration from their TUI approach, provider abstraction, or general agent patterns. The pi website mentions "opencode" nowhere explicitly, but the coding agent space cross-pollinates heavily.

## 4. Agent Teams / Worker Agents in Coding Tools
- **Claude Code Agent Teams**: Experimental feature (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`) for orchestrating multiple Claude sessions with inter-agent messaging
- **agent-era/devteam** (258 stars): Multi-agent CLI orchestrator using tmux, supports Claude Code/Codex/Gemini agents in parallel
- **tobias-walle/agency** (18 stars): Rust-based AI agent orchestrator CLI inspired by Lazygit, uses git worktrees + tmux for isolation
- **nekocode/agent-team**: Multi-agent CLI via Agent Client Protocol (ACP), supports 20+ agents including pi
- **nicobailon/pi-subagents** (63 stars): Independent pi extension for async subagent delegation with chains, parallel execution, TUI clarification, and session sharing

## 5. Pi's Own Subagent Story
- Pi (badlogic/pi-mono) **intentionally skips** sub-agents and plan mode (stated on buildwithpi.ai: "Pi ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub-agents and plan mode")
- There was an RFC issue (#552) by @cmf to extract subagent execution into a reusable library, which was closed with the maintainer noting subagent orchestration should be a community extension, not core
- The extension system enables community-built subagent solutions (nicobailon/pi-subagents, oh-my-pi's subagents plugin)
