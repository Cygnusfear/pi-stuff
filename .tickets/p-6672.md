# Improve teams list with started age

Update teams activity summaries to include how long ago each worker was started, in addition to last output age, so it's easier to tell when a team worker began.



## Goal
Add started-age info to teams list/widget/stuck activity output.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `formatRuntimeSummary` includes a readable "started <time ago>" segment based on worker spawn time.
- [ ] Teams tool list rows include both started and last output ages for each worker.
- [ ] Teams TUI widget activity lines include started age.
- [ ] Tests cover the new formatting behavior and expected output contains started age.

## Verification
- [ ] Run team-related tests for teams/activity and teams/tool-list
- [ ] Run targeted tests to ensure no regressions in stuck notification path.

## Worktree
