# Oracle 3: Cosmology (run 5)

Research findings on active cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, including recent episodes and hot topics (Brave web search based).



## Goal
Document at least 5 active cosmology podcasts with 2025-2026 activity, recent episodes, and current hot topics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 5 podcasts are identified as active in 2025-2026
- [ ] Each podcast includes a recent episode/reference and topic focus
- [ ] Cross-podcast hot topics are synthesized

## Verification
- [ ] Brave web search results captured for each podcast
- [ ] Ticket notes include podcast-by-podcast findings and synthesized trends

## Worktree
- .

FINDINGS (Brave web search, Feb 2026 snapshot)\n\nActive cosmology podcasts (2025-2026):\n1) Into the Impossible (Brian Keating)\n- Evidence of activity: Apple listing updated Dec 24, 2025; Spotify episode Dec 15, 2025; Podtail references Oct 2025 content.\n- Recent topic signals: interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, cosmic events, extinction-scale impacts, cosmology/philosophy crossover.\n- Sources: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/into-the-impossible-with-brian-keating/id1169885840 ; open.spotify.com/episode/4Wb0Muh9T0z6ya4Nud6XTu ; podtail.com/en/podcast/into-the-impossible/\n\n2) StarTalk Radio\n- Evidence of activity: Apple listing Jan 25, 2026.\n- Recent topic signals: quantum theory, cosmological constant, retrocausality, block universe questions (Cosmic Queries with Charles Liu).\n- Sources: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/startalk-radio/id325404506 ; startalkmedia.com/show/cosmic-queries-quantum-consciousness-with-charles-liu/\n\n3) The Supermassive Podcast (Royal Astronomical Society)\n- Evidence of activity: Apple listing Dec 1, 2025; bonus episode Sep 9, 2025.\n- Recent topic signals: black hole cosmology framing ("Are we living in a black hole?"), galaxy environment thought experiments, public-facing astrophysics Q&A.\n- Sources: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-supermassive-podcast/id1495324190 ; supermassive.supportingcast.fm/listen/the-supermassive-podcast/bonus-are-we-living-in-a-black-hole\n\n4) The Joy of Why (Quanta)\n- Evidence of activity: Apple listing indicates new episodes through 2025.\n- Recent topic signals: origins of the universe, Hawking/Hertog late-universe ideas, skepticism of naive multiverse narratives, anthropic/cosmological selection framing.\n- Sources: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-joy-of-why/id1608948873 ; quantamagazine.org/why-did-the-universe-begin-20250724/\n\n5) Sean Carroll's Mindscape\n- Evidence of activity: official podcast page + Apple/AMA entries in late 2025.\n- Recent topic signals: fine-tuning, cosmological constant, initial conditions, multiverse debates, naturalness.\n- Sources: preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/ ; preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2025/10/06/331-solo-fine-tuning-god-and-the-multiverse/ ; preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2025/12/15/ama-december-2025/\n\n6) Astronomy Cast (bonus, also active)\n- Evidence of activity: Apple lists episodes as recent as ~1 week ago (Feb 2026 view), including Dec 2025 stream references.\n- Recent topic signals: matter/antimatter asymmetry, dark matter, early universe probes (21-cm hydrogen line), galaxy formation.\n- Sources: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/astronomy-cast/id191636169 ; astronomycast.com/podcasts/\n\nCross-podcast hot topics in 2025-2026:\n- Fine-tuning, multiverse, and anthropic reasoning are resurging in public cosmology discussions.\n- Black-hole-centered cosmology ideas continue to trend as speculative explainers for wide audiences.\n- Quantum foundations and cosmology overlap (retrocausality, block universe, consciousness tie-ins) are highly visible.\n- Early-universe structure probes (dark matter, hydrogen 21-cm line, galaxy formation) remain core science content.\n- Interstellar-object narratives (e.g., 3I/ATLAS references in science media) are being used as cosmology-adjacent hooks.\n\nMethod:\n- Brave web search only; prioritized primary sources (official show pages, Apple listings, publisher pages) over aggregators where possible.
