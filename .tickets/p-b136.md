# You are Oracle #4. Research the latest cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026 and what they're discussing. Use brave web search extensively. Find at least 5-10 active podcasts, their recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension, etc.), and notable guests. Save findings as a ticket: title "Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 4)", tags "research,oracle", type "task".

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:10:06Z**

Started research pass. Pulling 2025-2026 cosmology podcast data via Brave (show pages, episode feeds, and topic/guest signals).

**2026-02-25T09:10:48Z**

Progress: gathered and triangulated sources for 9 active shows (show pages/RSS/listings), now compiling episode-level findings + topic synthesis into research ticket p-27af.

**2026-02-25T09:11:23Z**

DONE: Completed Oracle #4 run. Used extensive Brave web research across show pages/RSS/listings and produced research artifact ticket p-27af ('Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 4)') with findings on 9 active cosmology podcasts (2025-2026), recent episodes, hot topics (Hubble tension, dark-energy evolution, JWST, early-universe models, dark matter), and notable guests.
