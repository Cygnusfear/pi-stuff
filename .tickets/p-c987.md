# Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 6)

Brave/web research snapshot (Feb 2026) on active cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, including recent episodes and hot-topic synthesis.

## Method

- Used Brave web search (llm_context) first to identify active shows, episode recency, and themes.
- Cross-checked a subset via direct show pages/RSS for latest publish dates and topic accuracy.
- Note: Brave hit API usage-limit (402) during later query expansion; synthesis below uses already-collected Brave results plus direct source verification.

## Active podcasts (2025-2026)

### 1) StarTalk Radio (Neil deGrasse Tyson)
- Activity signal: ongoing weekly releases through Feb 2026.

  - Jan 20, 2026 — *Cosmic Queries – The Complex Universe with Sean Carroll* (entropy, many worlds, theory of everything)
  - Dec 16, 2025 — *Origins of Dark Energy with Adam Riess* (Hubble tension, cosmic expansion)

### 5) Sean Carroll’s Mindscape
- Activity signal: weekly in Jan/Feb 2026 (latest visible: Feb 23, 2026).
- Cosmology-relevant recent episodes:
  - Nov 10, 2025 — *Andrew Jaffe on Models, Probability, and the Universe*

## Hot cosmology topics across these shows (2025-2026)

1. **Hubble tension + dark energy uncertainty**
   - Frequent framing: “crisis in cosmology,” possible beyond-ΛCDM interpretations, measurement-systematics debate.
2. **JWST-era early universe anomalies**
   - “Little red dots,” unexpectedly early massive structures, and challenges to galaxy-formation timelines.
3. **Matter–antimatter asymmetry and early-universe initial conditions**
   - Why matter dominates; links to particle physics and baryogenesis.
4. **Black hole fundamentals**
   - Information paradox, singularities, accretion/awakening behavior, and horizon-level conceptual issues.
5. **Multiverse, fine-tuning, and inflation-adjacent ideas**
   - Anthropic reasoning, model selection, and philosophical-scientific boundary questions.
6. **Near-term observatory/missions outlook shaping cosmology**
   - Vera Rubin, Artemis-era context, dark-sky concerns, and observational program planning.

## Bottom line

Cosmology podcast coverage in 2025-2026 is highly active, with the strongest recurring themes being dark energy/Hubble tension, JWST-driven early-universe surprises, and renewed focus on foundational questions (fine-tuning, multiverse, black-hole information).
