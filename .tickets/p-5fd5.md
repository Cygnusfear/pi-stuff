# You are Oracle #1 in a Delphi consultation — one of 2 independent oracles investigating the same question.

CORE QUESTION: What are the latest and most notable cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, and what topics/discoveries are they currently discussing?

This is a pure web research task. Use web search (brave search) extensively to find:
- Active cosmology podcasts (dedicated + physics/science podcasts covering cosmology)
- Their most recent episodes and topics
- New discoveries, theories, or debates in cosmology being discussed right now
- Notable guests or interviews

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- At least 5-10 active cosmology podcasts
- Summary of hottest topics in recent episodes (2025-2026)
- Emerging trends or debates

When complete, save findings as a ticket:
- title: "Oracle 1: Cosmology podcasts (run 3)"
- description: Your FULL findings
- tags: "research,oracle"
- type: "task"

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:07:16Z**

Started research: collecting active 2025-2026 cosmology podcasts, latest episode recency, and topic trends via Brave + primary show pages.

**2026-02-25T09:08:07Z**

Progress: compiled candidate list of active shows (Astronomy Cast, Supermassive, Why This Universe, Mindscape, StarTalk, Space Nuts, others) and verified 2025-2026 episode/topic signals (DESI dark-energy evolution, JWST little red dots, Hubble tension, Euclid results). Now drafting final synthesis + creating handoff ticket artifact.

**2026-02-25T09:08:46Z**

Created research artifact ticket p-85fe ('Oracle 1: Cosmology podcasts (run 3)') with full findings: 10 active podcasts + 2025-2026 hot-topic synthesis (DESI evolving dark energy, JWST little red dots, Hubble/multi-tension landscape, Euclid signals).

**2026-02-25T09:08:51Z**

DONE: Completed oracle research and created handoff ticket p-85fe with full Feb-2026 snapshot. Included 10 active/notable podcasts and current topic map: DESI evolving dark energy, JWST little red dots + early SMBH growth, Hubble/S8 tensions, beyond-LCDM model debates, and Euclid early-result implications.

**2026-02-25T09:08:55Z**

DONE: Task completed.
