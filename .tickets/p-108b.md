# Oracle 6: Cosmology (run 4)

Research snapshot (Feb 2026): active cosmology/space podcasts in 2025-2026, with recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension), and notable guests.



## Goal
Document 5-10 active podcasts discussing current cosmology topics in 2025-2026, including specific episodes and guests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 8 active podcasts listed with 2025-2026 activity evidence
- [ ] Each podcast includes at least one recent episode/topic reference
- [ ] Synthesis includes cross-podcast hot topics and guest patterns

## Verification
- [ ] Brave web snippets include date-stamped episode or feed evidence
- [ ] Entries prioritize official show pages, RSS feeds, Apple listings, or host sites

## Worktree
- .

Findings (Feb 2026 snapshot, Brave-heavy):\n\n1) StarTalk Radio (active)\n- Evidence: StarTalk archive + Apple listing show Dec 16, 2025 episode “Origins of Dark Energy with Adam Riess.”\n- Topics: dark energy history, Hubble tension, universe expansion age/fate framing.\n- Notable guest(s): Adam Riess (Nobel laureate); also Wendy Freedman in Sept 2025 “Solving the Crisis in Cosmology.”\n\n2) Sean Carroll’s Mindscape / Preposterous Universe (active)\n- Evidence: Episode 310 (Mar 31, 2025) “Marc Kamionkowski on Dark Energy and Cosmic Anomalies.”\n- Topics: DESI hints of evolving dark energy, Hubble tension, early-vs-late universe fits, cosmological model stress tests.\n- Notable guest(s): Marc Kamionkowski.\n\n3) Astronomy Cast (active)\n- Evidence: Episode #749 (Mar 2025) “Dark Energy Changing Over Time.”\n- Topics: whether dark energy is dynamic, impact on ΛCDM assumptions, observational interpretation.\n- Notable host/expert profile: Fraser Cain + Dr. Pamela Gay format centered on astronomy/cosmology explainers.\n\n4) The Supermassive Podcast (Royal Astronomical Society) (active)\n- Evidence: Acast feed shows multiple 2025 updates (e.g., Nov 14, 2025 “Can JWST detect exomoons?”, Sep 9, 2025 “Are we living in a black hole?”, Aug 12 “What Shape is Space?”).\n- Topics: JWST capabilities, black-hole cosmology questions, shape/geometry of space, broad contemporary astro themes.\n- Notable guests: rotating experts incl. Dr Ziri Younsi (EHT collaborator), ESA astronaut Rosemary Coogan (bonus segment), etc.\n\n5) Ask a Spaceman (Paul M. Sutter) (active)\n- Evidence: host site lists steady cadence through 2025 and into 2026 (e.g., Feb 3, 2026 episode 265; Dec 2025 “Does the Universe Have Extra Dimensions?”).\n- Topics: cosmology fundamentals to frontier questions (extra dimensions, cosmic voids, gravitational waves and Big Bang links).\n- Notable host: Paul M. Sutter (active science communicator on cosmology tension discussions in media/podcast circuits).\n\n6) Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe (active)\n- Evidence: iHeart episode feed includes 2025 episodes (equinox listener Qs; dark-matter-focused episodes in listing corpus).\n- Topics: dark matter searches, black holes, cosmic structure and astrophysics explainers for mainstream audience.\n- Notable hosts: Daniel Whiteson + Jorge Cham (and frequent guest-host variants).\n\n7) Into the Impossible with Brian Keating (active)\n- Evidence: Apple/Podbean show frequent Dec 2025 releases; cosmology-relevant episodes include Andrew Jaffe discussion of inflation/Hubble tension/random universe framing.\n- Topics: Big Bang/inflation pressure tests, Hubble discrepancy, dark matter/dark energy debates, observational limits.\n- Notable guests: Andrew Jaffe; broader roster often includes leading cosmologists/astronomers.\n\n8) The Jodcast (Jodrell Bank) (active)\n- Evidence: Archive shows monthly 2025 episodes incl. Feb 2025 mention of “new development in the quest to solve the Hubble tension,” June 2025 on galaxy clustering for cosmology, Dec 2025 on pulsar timing and early-universe implications.\n- Topics: Hubble tension updates, cosmological probes (weak lensing, galaxy clustering, pulsar timing arrays), JWST/exoplanet crossover.\n- Notable guests: Joe Zuntz, Kai Schmitz, and rotating research staff.\n\n9) Big Picture Science (active)\n- Evidence: official episode page shows 2025 run with astronomy-heavy episodes (e.g., “Scoping Out the Universe,” “Beyond the Standard Model”).\n- Topics: observational frontiers, FRB implications, beyond-standard-model framing tied to dark matter/energy gaps.\n- Notable hosts/guests: Seth Shostak & Molly Bentley with rotating experts.\n\n10) The Infinite Monkey Cage (active, broad-science but recurring cosmology/astro)\n- Evidence: BBC/podcast listings show 2025 episodes incl. “Saturn v Jupiter” and “Should We Settle in Space?” plus 2025-12 “Fusion.”\n- Topics: planetary science, space settlement, fusion and astrophysical context; less dedicated to cosmology tensions but still influential in public discourse.\n- Notable guests: Tim Peake, Kelly Weinersmith, others.\n\nCross-podcast hot-topic map (2025-2026):\n- Dark energy dynamics and DESI-era interpretation are central (Mindscape, Astronomy Cast, StarTalk).\n- Hubble tension remains a mainstream “open problem” narrative; now framed with better systematics + JWST calibration debate (StarTalk, Mindscape, Jodcast, Keating).\n- JWST moved from “new telescope excitement” to specific cosmology stress tests (distance ladder calibration, early-galaxy anomalies, exomoon/early-universe constraints).\n- Black holes and early-universe structure are still audience magnets, often linked to broader cosmology speculation.\n- Guest ecology is strong: Adam Riess, Wendy Freedman, Marc Kamionkowski, and multiple observatory-linked experts recur across formats.\n\nMethod note:\n- Prioritized official show pages, RSS feeds, Apple listings, and host sites where possible.\n- Used Brave web search extensively, then triangulated dates/topics with source metadata.
