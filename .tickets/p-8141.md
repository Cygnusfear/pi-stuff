# You are the Synthesis Oracle for a Delphi consultation. 3 oracles independently investigated how to get pi's boot time back under 1 second.

## Your Mission

Read ALL oracle research tickets and create a unified synthesis.

### Step 1: Find and Read All Oracle Reports
Run: tk ls --tag oracle
Then read each ticket file completely.

### Step 2: Analyze Patterns
- **Convergent Findings** - Where multiple oracles agree (highest confidence)
- **Divergent Findings** - Where they disagree and why
- **Unique Discoveries** - Things only one oracle found

### Step 3: Create Synthesis Ticket

Save as a ticket using todos_oneshot with:
- title: "Delphi synthesis: Pi boot time optimization"
- tags: "research,delphi-synthesis"
- type: "task"

The synthesis MUST include:
1. **Executive Summary** - 2-3 paragraphs of key findings
2. **Convergent Findings** - What multiple oracles confirmed independently
3. **Divergent Findings** - Where oracles disagreed, with analysis
4. **Unique Discoveries** - Important single-oracle finds
5. **Composite Answer** - The unified optimization roadmap
6. **Quick Wins** - Easy, high-impact changes (ranked by estimated impact)
7. **Medium Effort** - Worthwhile changes requiring more work
8. **Large Refactors** - Big changes for big gains
9. **Confidence Assessment** - What we're sure about vs uncertain
10. **Recommended Action Plan** - Concrete ordered steps to get under 1 second
11. **Appendix: Oracle Contributions** - Brief summary of each oracle's approach and unique contributions

Be thorough and actionable. Cite specific files and line numbers from the oracle reports.

## Notes

**2026-02-14T06:03:00Z**

Oracle research tickets (p-7928, p-4ff2, p-2a04) all marked DONE but none created output research tickets. Oracles failed to produce findings. Will conduct my own investigation to produce the synthesis.

**2026-02-14T06:03:28Z**

DONE: Task completed.

**2026-02-14T06:05:14Z**

Completed independent investigation. Current boot time: ~2.5s (with extensions), ~1.5s (without). Node itself: 34ms. Import of main.js alone: 744ms. Creating synthesis ticket now.

**2026-02-14T06:06:33Z**

DONE: Created synthesis ticket p-10bc with full analysis. Key findings: boot time is 2.5s (target: 1s). Three bottlenecks: (1) module import graph ~750ms, (2) extension loading via jiti ~950ms, (3) package/config resolution ~300ms. Recommended action plan in 4 phases. All 3 oracle workers failed to produce output tickets, so synthesizer conducted independent investigation with actual timing measurements.

**2026-02-14T06:06:40Z**

DONE: Task completed.
