# Oracle 2: Cosmology (run 6)

Brave web research snapshot (Feb 2026) on active cosmology podcasts and current discussion themes in 2025-2026, including recent episodes and hot-topic synthesis.

   - Coverage: singularities, black-hole-adjacent density limits, least-action and fundamental-physics explainers.

## What They’re Discussing Right Now (hot topics)

- **Dark-sector physics**: dark matter candidates/signatures, dark-energy origin/evolution, and implications for cosmic expansion.
- **Black-hole physics boom**: information paradox, black-hole growth/awakening, singularities, and extreme compact objects.
- **Early-universe tension narratives**: matter-antimatter imbalance, bubble-universe ideas, and Big Bang-adjacent questions.
- **Quantum-to-cosmos bridge**: quantum eraser, tunneling, least-action, and whether new fundamental frameworks are needed.
- **Mission-linked cosmology**: Artemis II, Venus/Mars plans, and telescope upgrades feeding back into cosmological interpretation.

## Synthesis

The 2025-2026 cosmology podcast ecosystem is active and highly iterative: episodes quickly connect fresh mission/news cycles to deeper unresolved questions (dark sector, black holes, early universe, and quantum foundations). The strongest recurring pattern is that shows are not presenting cosmology as "settled," but as a live debate constrained by incoming observations and experiments.

## Method notes

- Discovery phase used **Brave web search** (multiple targeted queries for show recency and episode pages).
- Then validated recency and episode details on direct show pages/RSS feeds for the final list.

## Goal
Document at least 5 active cosmology podcasts with 2025-2026 recency evidence, representative recent episodes, and a synthesis of hot topics discussed across shows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] At least 5 active podcasts identified with evidence of recent 2025-2026 activity
- [x] Recent episode examples included for each podcast
- [x] Cross-podcast hot topic synthesis included

## Verification
- [x] Sources gathered via Brave web search and directly checked on show pages/RSS feeds
- [x] Findings written into ticket body

## Worktree
- .

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:26:30Z**

DONE: Compiled Feb 2026 cosmology podcast research with 6 active shows, recent 2025-2026 episodes, and cross-podcast hot-topic synthesis. Sources discovered via Brave and validated on show pages/RSS.
