# Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 4)

Research snapshot (Feb 2026) of active cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, with emphasis on recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension), and notable guests. Sources collected primarily via Brave web search against show pages, feeds, and podcast listings.



## Goal
Document 5-10 active cosmology podcasts and what they are currently discussing (2025-2026), including notable guests and recurring topic trends.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] List at least 5 active podcasts with 2025-2026 recency evidence
- [ ] Include example recent episodes per show (title/date/topic)
- [ ] Identify hot cross-show cosmology topics (e.g., Hubble tension, dark energy evolution, JWST anomalies, early universe)
- [ ] Name notable guests appearing in recent episodes
- [ ] Capture a concise synthesis of what the podcast ecosystem is focusing on

## Verification
- [ ] Cross-check each show against primary or near-primary listing/feed pages where available
- [ ] Prefer recency and topic overlap evidence from episode titles/descriptions
- [ ] Ensure findings are specific enough to compare across shows

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:10:55Z**

Findings (part 1/3) — Active shows + recency evidence (2025-2026): 1) Sean Carroll's Mindscape: Ep 310 (2025-03-31) Marc Kamionkowski on dark energy evolution + Hubble tension; Ep 316 (2025-05-26) Big Bang and before; Ep 335 (2025-11-10) universe models/probability. 2) StarTalk Radio: 'Solving the Crisis in Cosmology with Wendy Freedman' (2025-09-23); 'Origins of Dark Energy with Adam Riess' (2025-12-16); plus Hubble/JWST discussion episodes with Hakeem Oluseyi. 3) Astronomy Cast: Ep 749 'Dark Energy Changing Over Time' (2025-03-31) focused on DESI, evolving dark energy, Hubble tension.

Findings (part 2/3) — More active shows: 4) Ask a Spaceman! (Paul Sutter): AaS 256-265 span Sep 2025-Feb 2026; includes 'What Can Gravitational Waves Teach Us About the Big Bang?' (2025-09-23), 'Are the Cosmic Voids Really Empty?' (2025-07-08), 'Does the Universe Have Extra Dimensions?' (2025-12-16), 'Does Antimatter Fall Up?' (2026-02-03). 5) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS): 2025 run includes 'What Shape is Space?' (2025-08-12) and black-hole/cosmology Q&A episodes with Dr Becky Smethurst/Dr Robert Massey. 6) Space Nuts: 2025 episodes repeatedly center dark matter/dark energy, black holes, cosmology what-ifs (e.g., Jan 2025 dark-energy model challenge; Jul/Sep 2025 dark matter Q&A).

**2026-02-25T09:11:05Z**

Findings (part 3/3) — Additional shows + synthesis: 7) John Michael Godier's Event Horizon: Jan 2026 episodes include Neil Turok on universe origins, Brian Keating on big-bang experiments, and black-hole population discussions. 8) Into the Impossible (Brian Keating): Dec 2025 episodes discuss dark matter/dark energy, Hubble discrepancy, CMB/Big-Bang framing with guests incl. Avi Loeb and crossovers with other science hosts. 9) Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe: active in 2025-2026 with frequent dark matter/early-universe/cosmic-structure explainers and listener Q&A format. Cross-show hot topics: (a) Hubble tension as a still-open precision-cosmology problem, (b) DESI-driven hints dark energy may evolve, (c) JWST as independent distance-ladder and early-galaxy stress-test, (d) early-universe origin models (pre-Big-Bang, inflation alternatives), (e) dark matter identity + alternative gravity debate. Notable guests appearing repeatedly across the ecosystem: Wendy Freedman, Adam Riess, Marc Kamionkowski, Neil Turok, Avi Loeb, Hakeem Oluseyi, Paul Sutter, Fred Watson, Dr Becky Smethurst.

DONE: Compiled Feb 2026 cosmology-podcast landscape with 9 active shows, 2025-2026 recency evidence, episode-level topic mapping, notable guests, and cross-show trend synthesis (Hubble tension, evolving dark energy, JWST impacts, early-universe models, dark matter debates).
