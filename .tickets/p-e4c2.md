## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:20:39Z**

Started research. Pulling 2025-2026 cosmology podcast data via Brave search, focusing on active shows, recent episodes, and recurring hot topics.

**2026-02-25T09:21:07Z**

Progress: gathered Brave evidence from Apple Podcasts, official feeds/pages, and publisher pages for active shows (Universe Today, Supermassive, Ask a Spaceman, Astronomy Cast, StarTalk, Mindscape, Why This Universe). Now synthesizing recency + hot-topic map.

**2026-02-25T09:21:37Z**

DONE: Research completed with Brave (Feb 2026 snapshot). Identified 7 active/recent cosmology podcasts and synthesized 2025-2026 topic trends. Findings saved to ticket p-ffcc ("Oracle 4: Cosmology (run 5)", tags: research,oracle). Key shows covered: Universe Today, Supermassive, Ask a Spaceman, Astronomy Cast, StarTalk, Mindscape, Why This Universe. Main hot topics: Hubble tension/evolving dark energy, black-hole information and early SMBHs, inflation-era probes and gravitational waves, JWST-era cosmology anomalies, and Artemis-adjacent cosmology discussion.
