# You are Oracle #5. Research the latest cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026 and what they're discussing. Use brave web search extensively. Find at least 5-10 active podcasts, their recent episodes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension, etc.), and notable guests. Save findings as a ticket: title "Oracle 5: Cosmology (run 4)", tags "research,oracle", type "task".

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:10:05Z**

Started research: gathering 2025-2026 cosmology podcast data via Brave across show pages, episode feeds, and topic trends (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension).

**2026-02-25T09:10:53Z**

Progress: compiled candidate podcast set and verified recency from primary feeds/pages (Astronomy Cast RSS, Supermassive Acast feed, Ask a Spaceman show page, Why This Universe feed, StarTalk archives, Mindscape episodes, Joy of Why feed, Into the Impossible listings). Now synthesizing topics + guests + 2025-2026 trend map.

**2026-02-25T09:11:32Z**

DONE: Completed Brave-heavy research on latest cosmology podcasts (2025-2026). Identified and synthesized 9 active shows with recent episodes, hot topics (evolving dark energy/DESI, Hubble tension, JWST little red dots, early SMBH growth, early-universe conditions), and notable guests. Findings saved in ticket p-9c1e ('Oracle 5: Cosmology (run 4)'), now closed with full summary.

**2026-02-25T09:11:47Z**

DONE: Task completed.
