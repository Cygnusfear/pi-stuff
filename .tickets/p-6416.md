# Strengthen teams worker prompt guard protocol for ticket update/close

Update teams worker prompt to enforce a guard protocol: after finishing work, worker must update ticket with done summary and close it. Add/adjust tests for prompt text.



## Goal
Ensure team workers always receive explicit, high-priority instruction to update ticket and close it at end of work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Worker prompt contains explicit mandatory guard protocol language for final ticket update and closure.
- [ ] Prompt test coverage verifies the guard protocol text is present.
- [ ] Existing teams tests still pass.

## Verification
- [ ] Run targeted teams tests that cover buildWorkerPrompt expectations.

## Worktree
