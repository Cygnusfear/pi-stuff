## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:24:20Z**

Started research. Pulling Feb 2026 snapshot via Brave web search and verifying active cosmology podcasts with recent 2025-2026 episodes/topics.

**2026-02-25T09:25:52Z**

Progress: Ran Brave web search (broad cosmology podcasts 2025/2026 query) and identified candidate shows; then verified activeness via each show's RSS feed to capture latest episode dates/titles. Brave API hit 402 usage cap after initial pass, so I continued with primary-source feed validation for accuracy.

**2026-02-25T09:26:32Z**

Findings compiled and saved to new ticket p-ea9e (title: Oracle 1: Cosmology (run 6), tags: research,oracle, type: task). Includes 6 active podcasts, recent 2025-2026 episodes, and hot-topic convergence.

**2026-02-25T09:26:36Z**

DONE: Completed Feb 2026 cosmology podcast research using Brave discovery + primary RSS verification. Saved full findings to ticket p-ea9e (Oracle 1: Cosmology (run 6), tags research,oracle) with 6 active podcasts, recent 2025-2026 episodes, and cross-podcast hot-topic synthesis (black holes/transients, math+quantum foundations, dark sector tensions, mission-driven cosmology).

DONE: Task completed.
