# Oracle 2: Cosmology (run 5)

Brave web research snapshot (Feb 2026) of active cosmology podcasts, recent 2025-2026 episodes, and dominant discussion topics.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:21:50Z**

Findings (Brave, Feb 2026): 1) Astronomy Cast (astronomycast.libsyn.com + Apple) active through Feb 2026; recent eps include #782 Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (Feb 2026), #781 Awakening Black Holes, #780 Asteroids/Comets; late-2025 cosmology ep #776 Matter-Antimatter Dichotomy. 2) Ask a Spaceman (pmsutter.com/shows/askaspaceman + Apple) active in 2026; Jan-Feb 2026 eps include Antimatter gravity test, Quantum Eraser, free will/physics; Dec 2025 has extra dimensions and black dwarfs. 3) Space Nuts (spacenutspodcast.com + iHeart) active Jan-Feb 2026 with episodes on dark matter, gravitational waves, Einstein crosses, Martian shorelines, black-hole thermodynamics. 4) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS/acast + Apple) active in 2026 with episodes on Artemis II, multiverse/time-travel adjacent Q&A, nebula collisions, mission outlook for 2026. 5) StarTalk Radio (startalkmedia + Apple) active Feb 2026; cosmology-focused recent episodes include Expanding Bubble Universes, Quantum Consciousness (cosmological constant/retrocausality), and cosmology-crisis/Hubble-tension discussion with Wendy Freedman. 6) Sean Carroll's Mindscape (preposterousuniverse.com + Apple) active weekly in 2026; cosmology-relevant episodes include Adam Elga on rationality in very large universes and 2025 episodes around dark energy/cosmic anomalies. Cross-podcast hot topics in 2025-2026: dynamic dark energy after DESI DR2 hints, Hubble tension and expansion-rate dispute, black-hole growth/information/quantum questions, primordial/early-universe structure (matter-antimatter, extra dimensions), and JWST-era anomaly framing (e.g., early giant black holes/high-z puzzles).
