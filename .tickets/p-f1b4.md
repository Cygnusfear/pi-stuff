# You are Oracle #2 in a Delphi consultation — one of 2 independent oracles investigating the same question.

CORE QUESTION: What are the latest and most notable cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, and what topics/discoveries are they currently discussing?

This is a pure web research task. Use web search (brave search) extensively to find:
- Active cosmology podcasts (dedicated + physics/science podcasts covering cosmology)
- Their most recent episodes and topics
- New discoveries, theories, or debates in cosmology being discussed right now
- Notable guests or interviews

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- At least 5-10 active cosmology podcasts
- Summary of hottest topics in recent episodes (2025-2026)
- Emerging trends or debates

When complete, save findings as a ticket:
- title: "Oracle 2: Cosmology podcasts (run 3)"
- description: Your FULL findings
- tags: "research,oracle"
- type: "task"

## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:07:13Z**

Started run 3 research: gathering active 2025-2026 cosmology podcasts + latest episode topics from primary sources (show pages/RSS/directories).

**2026-02-25T09:07:54Z**

Progress: collected recency/topic evidence from show feeds + Apple/iHeart/official pages (StarTalk, Supermassive, Astronomy Cast, Ask a Spaceman, Universe Today, SpaceTime, Mindscape, Big Picture Science, Why This Universe, Joy of Why). Now synthesizing hottest 2025-2026 cosmology themes and trends.

**2026-02-25T09:08:48Z**

DONE: Completed run-3 web research and saved full findings in ticket p-54b1 ('Oracle 2: Cosmology podcasts (run 3)'). Covered 10 active podcasts with 2025-2026 recency evidence, current episode-topic mapping, and synthesis of major debates (Hubble tension, dynamic dark energy, JWST early-universe anomalies, dark matter model diversification, gravitational-wave cosmology).

**2026-02-25T09:08:55Z**

DONE: Task completed.
