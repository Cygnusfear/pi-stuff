# Oracle 3: Cosmology (run 4)

Research snapshot (Feb 2026): latest active cosmology podcasts (2025-2026), recent episode themes, hot topics (dark energy, JWST, Hubble tension), and notable guests.



## Goal
Document 5-10 active cosmology podcasts with current episode evidence, topic trends, and notable guests from 2025-2026.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] List at least 5 active podcasts with episode-level recency evidence
- [ ] Summarize what each show is currently discussing in cosmology
- [ ] Identify cross-show hot topics (dark energy evolution, Hubble tension, JWST, etc.)
- [ ] Call out notable guests where available

## Verification
- [ ] Brave web search results cited from show pages, Apple listings, or episode pages
- [ ] At least one 2025-2026 episode reference per listed podcast

## Worktree
- .

Findings (Feb 2026 snapshot, Brave-heavy):

1) Sean Carroll's Mindscape / Preposterous Universe — active in 2025 with cosmology-specific episodes incl. #310 (Mar 31, 2025) Marc Kamionkowski on dark-energy evolution + DESI + Hubble tension; show feed also has later 2025 astronomy episodes. Notable guest: Marc Kamionkowski.
2) Astronomy Cast — active; Ep. 749 (Mar 2025) explicitly on dark energy changing over time, DESI signals, and implications for Hubble tension/new physics. Hosts: Fraser Cain, Dr. Pamela Gay.
3) StarTalk — active in late 2025/early 2026; episodes include 'Origins of Dark Energy with Adam Riess' and 'Hubble Trouble with Hakeem Oluseyi' covering Hubble tension, JWST, dark matter/energy. Notable guests: Adam Riess, Hakeem Oluseyi.
4) Ask a Spaceman! (Paul M. Sutter) — active through 2025 into 2026; episodes on cosmological horizons, Big Bang via gravitational waves, constants of nature, early giant black holes, extra dimensions. Host: Paul M. Sutter.
5) The Supermassive Podcast (Royal Astronomical Society) — active (new 2026 episode + 2025 run). Mix of listener Q&A and expert-led topics across black holes, structure of space, solar activity, cosmology basics. Notable guests in 2025 episodes include Dr Ziri Younsi, ESA astronaut Rosemary Coogan, Tim Peake, Meganne Christian, John McFall.
6) Daniel and Kelly's Extraordinary Universe (formerly Daniel & Jorge brand line) — active through 2025/2026 with regular universe-scale episodes (rogue planets/stars, dense objects, singularities, constants, cosmology-adjacent fundamentals). Hosts: Daniel Whiteson, Kelly Weinersmith.
7) This Week in Space — active through 2026; broader space-news show but repeatedly covers cosmology-relevant missions (JWST milestones, Roman telescope timing) and policy context affecting cosmology missions.
8) Space Nuts — active in 2025/2026; episodes discuss dark-energy challenges, JWST findings, and alternative-expansion interpretations in accessible Q&A format.

Cross-show hot topics:
- Dark energy might evolve over time (DESI-era discussion became mainstream in podcast coverage).
- Hubble tension remains unresolved and still framed as either new-physics signal or unresolved systematics.
- JWST is now central in both camps: helping tighten cosmology constraints while also fueling anomaly discussion (early massive galaxies, calibration issues, high-z structure debates).
- Cosmology podcasts increasingly blend strict cosmology with mission/policy tracking (Roman, DESI followups, survey strategy), not just theory-only episodes.
