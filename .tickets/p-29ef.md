# Oracle 5: Cosmology (run 5)

Brave web research on active cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, recent episodes, and hot discussion topics.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:21:47Z**

Findings (Brave, Feb 2026 snapshot): Active cosmology podcasts with recent 2025/2026 episodes include (1) StarTalk Radio — e.g., 'Solving the Crisis in Cosmology with Wendy Freedman' (Sep 23, 2025) on Hubble tension, dark-energy evolution, distance-ladder vs CMB methods; and 'Cosmic Queries - Flat Universe' (Aug 12, 2025) on universe geometry/origin questions. (2) Ask a Spaceman! — episodes through Dec 2025 incl. 'AaS! 261: What are Black Dwarfs?' and 'AaS! 259: Where Exactly is the Edge of the Universe?' covering cosmic horizons, black-hole growth, early universe and gravitational-wave/Big Bang topics. (3) The Cosmic Savannah — active through Dec 31, 2025; episodes on MeerKAT galaxy-evolution science, black holes/GRBs, and survey-era radio cosmology. (4) Daniel & Kelly's Extraordinary Universe (formerly Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe) — Jan 2026 episodes like 'The several styles of singularities' and Dec 2025 episodes on rogue planets / extreme density objects, with regular universe-scale physics framing. (5) The Supermassive Podcast — active Sep 2025 episodes on black holes, shape of space, and gravity. Additional active high-signal shows: Sean Carroll's Mindscape (Mar 2025 dark-energy/cosmic-anomalies episode; Feb 2026 'very large universe' reasoning) and Why This Universe? (2025 episodes on cosmology outlook + dark-energy discovery story). Cross-show hot topics in 2025-2026: DESI-driven dark-energy evolution hints, Hubble tension status, universe geometry/flatness, black-hole cosmology ideas, early-universe physics, and how new observatories (JWST/MeerKAT/next-gen surveys) shift cosmology constraints.
