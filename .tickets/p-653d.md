# Oracle 2: Cosmology (run 4)

Research snapshot (Feb 2026) of active cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, including recent episodes, hot topics (DESI/dark energy, Hubble tension, JWST, inflation/early universe), and notable guests.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:11:19Z**

Findings (Brave-heavy web research, primary sources prioritized):

1) Sean Carroll's Mindscape (active into 2026)
- Recency: main feed shows episodes through Feb 2026 (e.g., ep 345 on 2026-02-23).
- Cosmology episodes: ep 310 (Mar 2025) with Marc Kamionkowski on evolving dark energy, DESI/DES, Hubble tension; ep 316 (May 2025) on Big Bang and before.
- Hot topics: evolving dark energy, cosmic anomalies, Hubble tension, pre-Big-Bang ideas.
- Notable guests: Marc Kamionkowski, Niayesh Afshordi, Phil Halper.

2) Astronomy Cast (weekly, active through Jan 2026)
- Recency: Apple listing shows Jan 2026 episodes (e.g., Ep. 778).
- Cosmology episodes: Ep. 749 (Mar 2025) “Dark Energy Changing Over Time.”
- Hot topics: DESI implications, cosmological constant vs dynamical DE, Hubble tension, matter-antimatter asymmetry.
- Hosts/regular experts: Fraser Cain, Dr. Pamela Gay.

3) StarTalk Radio (active through Dec 2025)
- Recency: archives include Dec 2025 “Origins of Dark Energy” episode.
- Cosmology episodes: Mar 2025 “Hubble Trouble with Hakeem Oluseyi”; Dec 2025 with Adam Riess.
- Hot topics: Hubble tension, dark energy origin, JWST constraints, cosmological-model stress tests.
- Notable guests: Hakeem Oluseyi, Adam Riess (Nobel laureate).

4) The Jodcast (monthly, active through Dec 2025)
- Recency: archive includes monthly 2025 issues + Dec 2025 episode on Pulsar Timing Array and early-universe cosmology.
- Cosmology episodes: Feb 2025 (Hubble-tension update), Jun 2025 (galaxy clustering/redshifts for cosmology), Dec 2025 (PTA + early universe).
- Hot topics: Hubble crisis framing, galaxy clustering, weak lensing, early-universe probes.
- Notable guests: Joe Zuntz, Kai Schmitz.

5) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS; active through Dec 2025)
- Recency: feed entries through Dec 2025.
- Cosmology-adjacent episodes in 2025: black hole hypotheses (“Are we living in a black hole?”), shape of space, primordial black hole discussions in bonus/Q&A threads.
- Hot topics: black-hole cosmology, large-scale structure questions, gravitational waves, observational constraints.
- Notable guests (2025 examples): Ziri Younsi, Rosemary Coogan (plus recurring Dr Becky Smethurst/Dr Robert Massey team).

6) Space Nuts (high-frequency, active through Dec 2025)
- Recency: numerous 2025 episodes and Dec 2025 releases.
- Cosmology episodes/topics: dark-energy debates, Hubble tension episodes, little-red-dots/JWST implications, dark-matter Q&A.
- Hot topics: DE alternatives, expansion-rate tension, JWST early-galaxy anomalies, primordial BH/dark matter links.
- Hosts/experts: Andrew Dunkley, Prof Fred Watson; recurring guest Prof Jonti Horner.

7) Ask a Spaceman (active through Feb 2026)
- Recency: show page lists episodes into Feb 2026 (e.g., AaS! 265).
- 2025 cosmology-leaning episodes include cosmic voids, constants of nature, giant early black holes, universe edge, extra dimensions.
- Hot topics: early-universe structure growth, foundational constants, spacetime geometry, Big Bang observables via GW context.
- Host: Paul M. Sutter.

8) Into the Impossible (active Jan 2026 with cosmology-heavy interviews)
- Recency: Jan 2026 episodes on cosmology uncertainty/probability and Hubble tension framing.
- Cosmology topics: inflation under pressure, “random universe” interpretation, epistemic limits in cosmology, Hubble-tension interpretation.
- Notable guest: Andrew Jaffe.

Cross-podcast topic convergence (2025-2026):
- Dark energy may evolve with time (DESI-driven discussion appears repeatedly).
- Hubble tension remains unresolved and is increasingly presented as potential new-physics territory (vs pure systematics).
- JWST is used as a key adjudicator: early-galaxy/little-red-dot tensions and local-distance-ladder crosschecks.
- Early-universe probes beyond CMB gain airtime (pulsar timing arrays, galaxy clustering, weak lensing, FRBs).

Method notes:
- Used Brave search extensively across official podcast pages, RSS feeds, Apple listings, and episode pages.
- Prioritized primary/near-primary sources when available (show feeds + show pages), and used directory mirrors for recency triangulation.
