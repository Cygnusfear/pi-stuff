# Oracle 6: Cosmology (run 6)

Brave-based research snapshot for active cosmology podcasts in 2025-2026, including recent episodes and hot topics.


## Notes

**2026-02-25T09:25:31Z**

Method: attempted fresh Brave web searches for run 6, but Brave API returned 402 usage-limit errors in this environment. I used prior same-day Brave-derived oracle snapshots (p-ffcc, p-85fe) as source material and synthesized a new run-6 report below.

Findings (2025-2026 active cosmology podcasts): (1) Astronomy Cast — active into Jan 2026 (Ep. 780, Jan 26 2026); recent topics include JWST little red dots, matter-antimatter asymmetry, and evolving dark energy/Hubble-tension implications. (2) The Supermassive Podcast (RAS) — active in Jan 2026 with Q&A/new-year episodes; topics include shape of space, black holes, time/gravity, Artemis-era context for modern cosmology. (3) StarTalk Radio — active through Feb 2026; recent episodes/discussions include black-hole information paradox, quantum foundations, and cosmological constant questions. (4) Sean Carroll’s Mindscape — weekly through Feb 2026; episodes/AMAs cover Big Bang-and-before ideas, anthropic reasoning in a large universe, fine-tuning, entropy, and multiverse framing. (5) Why This Universe? — active through late 2025 / Jan 2026; episodes include Hubble tension and what 2025 cosmology surveys could reveal; strong focus on dark energy model testing. (6) Universe Today Podcast / Space Bites+ — active in early 2026 (episodes surfaced as days-old in listings); topics include ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, late heavy bombardment revision, and black-hole/cosmological Q&A.

Cross-podcast hot-topic map (2025-2026): A) DESI-driven question of evolving dark energy (possible beyond-LCDM signal), B) Hubble tension + related multi-parameter tensions, C) JWST little-red-dot populations and unexpectedly early SMBH growth, D) black-hole information and quantum-gravity interpretation, E) inflation/pre-Big-Bang and fine-tuning debates, F) Euclid/large-scale-structure data as near-term tie-breakers. Net trend: podcasts now frame cosmology as a precision-tension era rather than a settled model.

Source pointers (from Brave-backed prior snapshots used in synthesis): Apple Podcasts listings (Astronomy Cast, Supermassive, StarTalk, Mindscape, Why This Universe?, Universe Today), official show pages/feeds (Astronomy Cast site+RSS, Mindscape site, StarTalk site, RAS/Supermassive pages, Why This Universe feed), and topic anchor coverage around DESI dark-energy results + JWST little-red-dot discussions.

**2026-02-25T09:25:49Z**

DONE: Run-6 cosmology podcast research ticket completed with 6 active podcasts, recent 2025-2026 episode signals, and synthesized hot-topic map. Includes source pointers and method caveat about current Brave API quota block in this environment.
