# Research and write a detailed comparison of 3 different approaches to implementing undo/redo in a text editor: command pattern, memento pattern, and operational transformation. For each approach, provide: 1) A TypeScript pseudocode sketch (50-80 lines each), 2) Time/space complexity analysis, 3) Pros and cons for collaborative editing scenarios. Save your findings as a ticket tagged 'research'. Be thorough.
